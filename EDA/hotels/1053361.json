  "description": "Enjoy the delights of Dubai without the typical hustle and bustle of a big city with a stay in Premier Inn Dubai Investments Park. Discover the theme parks, malls and many attractions of Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, too, while staying in a quiet but convenient location, ideal for both business and leisure travellers. Sip on a coffee at Costa, or grab breakfast, lunch and dinner at Nuevo Restaurant. Refresh in the rooftop pool, or work up a sweat in the gym (temporarily closed). Kick back and relax with a beverage at Mr Toad's Pub and Kitchen, before settling down in our slumber-inducing Hypnos beds with a choice of pillows for a good night's sleep, guaranteed. Explore more of Dubai with our free shuttle service (suspended until further notice) to The Walk at JBR, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Marina and Ibn Battuta Mall. Stay connected with free unlimited Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, or log on at our Business Centre. In line with official guidance, the Premier Inn Shuttle Bus Service is suspended until further notice. Weâ€™re sorry for any inconvenience caused, but hope you understand in these challenging times.",
