  "description": "Featuring 200 contemporary rooms and suites and three distinct food and beverage venues, Taj Jumeirah Lakes Towers has gifted Dubai with a new landmark, and JLT with its first luxury hotel. It brings with it two firsts in JLT – Paros, a Mediterranean inspired rooftop pool bar and restaurant, as well as an elegant ballroom. The hotel also introduces the renowned and much-loved Shamiana from the iconic Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai to the Middle East. Everything Taj Jumeirah Lakes Towers has to offer is a treat for the senses; whether it is the stunning cascade of light in the lobby, a palette of cuisines from 4 distinct dining venues including TJ’s – a bistro-café and NONYA - a Pan-Asian restaurant with strong influences from Singapore, Malaysia, and China. This new sensorial journey is harmonized through our intangible concept of ‘Tajness’ – a timeless combination of luxury, modernity, and legendary attention to detail. Our 5-star hotel in Dubai is conveniently located 30 minutes from both, Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central Airport, and is a five-minute walk from the metro station. It is also within easy reach of the city’s key commercial areas, and prominent tourist attractions; making it the default new HQ for Dubai’s leisure lovers and business elite.",
