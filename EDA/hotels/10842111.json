  "description": "Lapita, Dubai Parks and Resorts, Autograph Collection is a Polynesian-themed hotel located in the heart of Dubai Parks and Resorts in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. We are dedicated to families and friends who wish to stay close to all the activities that the theme parks have on offer. With 504 rooms, including 60 suites and 3 villas, our hotel is the perfect relaxation point after a day of adventures and fun. Part of Marriott's Autograph Collection, we offer five food and beverage outlets, outdoor pools, a spa and fitness centre as well as meeting and event facilities. The hotel's name was inspired by the pre-historic Pacific Ocean people and their journey and settlement into the Polynesian islands - this is known as the Lapita movement.. The design draws its inspiration from the exotic Polynesian landscapes, featuring tropical flowers, lagoon-style pools, themed kids activities and dining options.",
