As is characteristic of MGallery's 'Serenity' properties within its portfolio of over 100 hotels, the wellness philosophy runs throughout the hotel that inspires guests to live a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

Tucked away on the exclusive coastline of Palm Jumeirah's East Crescent, the beachfront destination houses 255 picturesque rooms and suites, all designed with natural elements, earth tones, and a harmonising Feng Shui philosophy throughout. At the heart of the resort is the Rayya Wellness Centre, inspired by a 360-degree holistic wellness concept, offering organic-based products, uplifting rejuvenation experiences, and transformational wellness retreats. The unique Rayya Spa features a distinctive array of wellbeing therapies and signature spa treatments, rejuvenating cryotherapy, detoxifying facials, and the traditional Hammam.
