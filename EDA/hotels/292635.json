  "description": "Cyprotel Faliraki is surrounded by gardens in a quiet area. It's on the edge of the bustling resort of Faliraki on the east coast of the Greek island of Rhodes. Refurbished in 2016, the hotel is within walking distance of the sand and pebble beach at Faliraki and the lively nightlife of the town centre. The hotel has three swimming pools and its own water park with six different flumes and slides, including one where four people can race each other to the bottom. There's also a shallow pool with a slide and water features for young children. There are many sporting activities to enjoy at the hotel, including beach volleyball, water polo, tennis, football, boules, pool and darts. The hotel organizes evening entertainment most nights, ranging from dance shows to karaoke. Faliraki has plenty of shops, bars and tavernas, plus nightclubs where you can dance until dawn. A shuttle bus will take you to Faliraki beach if you don't feel like walking. As well as the main stretch of sand, there are smaller beaches to explore, including the rocky but panoramic Anthony Quinn Bay. Rhodes town lies only a short drive away, offering both great restaurants and shopping as well as tourist attractions such as the Rodini Park and the Palace of the Grand Master. Strolling in the many streets and alleys of the old town is highly recommended. Please note, this hotel may be unsuitable for guests with mobility difficulties due to differences in levels and long distances within the resort.",
