      "text": "I had a very disappointing experience during my stay at this hotel. The overall condition of the hotel is desperately in need of renovation. It is evident that the employees lack basic manners and proper training in health and safety protocols. The hotel seems to be a breeding ground for infections. Despite booking two rooms for a week-long stay, we decided to check out a day earlier due to various issues. The hotel is clearly facing structural problems, and the entire staff gives off an unwelcoming vibe. When we checked out early, we were met with indifference from the five employees who were busy chatting at the reception. None of them bothered to inquire about our early departure or apologize for the dirty room and the flea bites my son suffered from. I have never encountered such laziness and poor quality in any Premier Inn across the country. I strongly advise against staying here. Although the manager attempted to accommodate us by offering different rooms, even the supposedly better rooms were extremely unclean. The only positive aspect of this hotel is the pub, Mr. Toads, which serves delicious food. However, it is evident that the pub is managed separately from the hotel.",

Your feedback regarding the condition of our property not meeting your expectations and the shortcomings in the service provided by our staff is truly concerning to us.\n\nI am surprised by your comments about our staff's manners, as our team has extensive training to ensure they meet the expectations of our valued guests, and our team they are specialist in spreading welcoming vibes.\n\nUpon investigating your concerns, it came to my attention that when you raised the issue of cleanliness in your room, our Housekeeping Manager promptly met with you, apologized, and immediately arranged for you to be moved to another room.\nThe cleanliness of the alternative room was thoroughly inspected, and a courtesy call was made from our reception team to ensure your satisfaction, which unfortunately was not mentioned at the time to allow us the opportunity to rectify any further concerns.\n\nPlease rest assured that we take health and safety matters seriously, and our team members receive ongoing training to ensure they are well-equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to maintain our standards.\n\nRegarding your son's discomfort, we promptly relocated you to another room in line with our health and safety protocols. It's important to note that our hotel has a comprehensive disinfection system in place, and the first room has been thoroughly inspected. However, no infection has been found to be the cause of any discomfort or itches.\nWhile we understand your concern, we would like to assure you that this is not indicative of any issues within our facilities, since the room was occupied by more than one person.\nWe take the well-being of our guests very seriously and strive to maintain a clean and safe environment at all times.\n\nUpon further investigation, it was noted that both rooms were not checked out through reception, thus our team had no opportunity to inquire about your reasons for leaving. Although your departure on March 5th at 19:22 was earlier than anticipated, it does not technically classify as an early departure as your reservation was scheduled until March 6th.\n\nWe appreciate your positive feedback regarding our pub, Mr. Toads, and we are pleased to hear that you enjoyed the food there.\n\nRest assured that your concerns have been shared with our management team, and immediate steps will be taken to address them. Your feedback is invaluable to us as it assists us in improving and providing a better experience for all our guests.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPeter Farhan\nOperations Manager",
