      "text": "First time staying at Mosaic Hotel in Rambla Catalunya and we can't wait to come back.We were visiting Barcelona (my hometown) during the half term break and we decided to book a couple of nights in this hotel.The stay didn't disappoint.The hotel is located in the city centre just a short walk from Casa Batllo and Passeig de Gracia.The hotel is located in a beautiful modernist building.We loved the very grand entrance and the modern lift.When we were waiting for our room to be ready we managed to enjoy the views from the rooftop where you can have free coffee ,tea,or hot chocolate.The room was fantastic!!!We were not expecting such a big room and huge bed.The room had a very modern bathroom/shower room with lovely toiletries,a big bed and a big sofa to relax after a long day exploring the city.Our room faced Rambla Catalunya and the views from the balcony were stunning.I am myself originally from Barcelona and I always wanted to stay in a place where i could enjoy being in Rambla Catalunya,a lovely mini Rambla with plenty of great places to eat and amazing boutiques to shop.Just below the hotel there's a very convenient traditional bakery/cafe where we could buy drinks,'bocadillos' or fresh coffee to take away with us.The front desk staff were welcoming and very nice and we will be definitely coming back to Mosaic in our next Barcelona break.",

      "text": "We stayed here for one night after spending two weeks biking the Camino Ignaciano.  We arrived early in the day and they stored our luggage for us.  There were a lot of resturants near the hotel.  Normally a lot of shops too I think, but it was their National Day so most shops were closed (that's OK, I don't like shopping anyway).  It was an easy walk to many historic sites.   That evening the staff gladly booked us a taxi to the hotel for the morning saying we needed to pre-arrange a taxi.  We had an interior room. It was small but comfortable.",

      "text": "What a wonderful oasis of calm and tranquility in the heart of Quadrat D‚ÄôOr in Barcelona and in a spectacular setting on Rambla de Catalunya. Beautiful architecture and design and it smells lovely inside too! The roof terrace is quiet and a welcome place to sit and read after a day out at the beach or exploring before getting ready for the evening. The rooms were bigger than expected and elegantly designed. Comfy beds and nice bathroom.  The light shafts between rooms meant that we didn‚Äôt have any neighbours and everyone is lovely - staff and guests. The lift had a glass wall on one side so you could see the height of the building and beautiful light fitting to look at as you moved between floors. Really well thought out as it made it feel airy in this tall slim building rather than getting in a dark box and then arriving at your floor. The staircase is also a thing of beauty and felt very grand. I want to go back to Barcelona for this hotel alone! What a gem. I‚Äôve been going to Barcelona since I was 14yrs old and this was the best experience yet. Fab bakery next door for breakfast and the restaurants in the centre of the street mean that there are always people around, taking a promenade or just sitting and chatting. ",

The shower had great pressure and although there is no kettle in the room, there is a coffee Dock on 6th floor with a fabulous roof top sun area. All staff where excellent,  be aware taxis cost around ‚Ç¨50 from the airport. Breakfast was not included but honestly there is an amazing restaurant that is2 doors down, opens at 7.30 am and is well priced and tasty.
