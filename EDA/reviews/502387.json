      "text": "We left very satisfied with the hotel we went to for the first time after finding it online and taking a risk with my wife.\nOur room, food and staff were of top quality. Cleanliness, order, courtesy and taste were remarkably attentive.\nRestaurants from different countries are worth trying and offer delicious meals. The Fajita we ate at the Mexican restaurant was made by a chef from Siirt, but it tasted great.\nMy only suggestion is that the beach should be maintained a little more. Since we spent almost all day on the beach, it is important that the beach is well-maintained and reflects the quality befitting the name and star of the hotel. In order to change the shabby atmosphere, broken and faded sun loungers, some moldy cushions should be checked and, if possible, the entire beach should be arranged in one piece with special sand.\nWe would like to thank Z√ºlal and Ms. Su for supporting us as customer assistants.\nIt's on the list of hotels I want to go to again...",

And there is a harbor just a short walk away. There is also an archaeological church on the beach (turn right). The bus to Bodrum stops in front of the door. Everything is very well organized in this fantastic hotel, which we will definitely visit again. The food was very varied and very tasty. Staff were friendly and very good. You will have several personal assistants who you can ask anything and help you with anything. The room was fully equipped and was cleaned twice a day. Beautiful beach with nice sunbeds and you can order food and drinks via a QR code. The same goes for the swimming pools. Various a la carte restaurants where you can eat very well. ",

      "text": "So where do I start.\n\nUpon arrival, just wow. You want into the beautiful hotel and someone is sat playing a grand piano. It was breath taking.\n\nYou check in and it's so seamless. You can sit and have a drink if you wish but its takes minutes to get checked it.\n\nOnce checked it, your bags are taken to your room, while you have a tour, this hotel is rather big! Maybe a map might be handy.\n\nThe rooms are beautiful. You have a mini bar which is replenished everyday for free.\n\nThe restaurants are fantastic. They will make food to the way you want it if you have fuss kids, like mine! Which is truly amazing. You have drinkable yogurts, pop yoghurt but they have bits in, formula milk which I could only see the brand aptamil, weaning pots. Honestly anything a baby needs, it's there! But if you can't see it, then you just need to ask.\n\nThe food was lovely for adults, plenty of choice. The only thing I was missing was a good chicken pitta kebab!\n\nWhen you arrive you join a WhatsApp group for your room which you get assistants, incase you want or need anything. We had Nada, Honda and Aizhan. All lovely people.\n\nNada was amazing, my 2 year old wasn't well and she was a fantastic help with the doctors. Thank you so much Nada.\n\nOn site you have a kids part which was handy for the hot days for my 2 little ones.\n\nThere is also a water park so all ages, the life guards are so friendly. Big shout out to Bunyamin! He went above and beyond to make your experience amazing!\n\nOverall this hotel was beautiful and a lovely experience. The only reason I haven't gave 5 stars is because there is only 1 heated pool and this doesn't have a kids pool in. The water was 26 degrees. It took your breath away when getting in. This meant my 2 children didn't use the pools, and that a big issue for us because my kids are water babies. Of the more pools where heated they 5star all the way!",

      "text": "10 nights in this spotlessly clean hotel superb staff , food and drink‚Äôs outstanding quality in all restaurants including the main restaurant which had multiple food choices available absolutely no complaints. Stunning accommodation thanks to staff for giving us 1046 in the centre of everything after formal request to hotel üëèüëè. Bodrum 15-20 minutes away in taxi , airport 30 minutes away in taxi . Bodrum around 400 lire inc tip . Entertainment absolutely first class best I have had in any hotel üè®. Staff so helpful it‚Äôs a pleasure to deal with them . Now for a few negatives. Lack of Toilet facilities around the whole complex very strange difficult to find in areas and needs to be addressed including beach toilets access. Some toilets with only one single toilet and being heavily used . Many many Russians in this hotel with many many young kids and a few number two‚Äôs being done and closing the large heated pool on 2-3 occasions. We went next door to the quiet cold pool for some relaxing quiet time and two young Russian kids sat at side and did a wee pee in the water üí¶ Disgusting. But also funny.  Service not great at the warm pool even the roller skate waiter better going to bar yourself . The large heated pool was outstanding just next to the üèñÔ∏è beach but mobbed with young noisy kids enjoying bless them . A very strong Russian presence at this hotel with so many young kids would deter me from returning to this Fantastic venue. Adults only area must be looked at asap and sterner control of pools with children being children. Love kids and my grandchildren who I take away twice a year and love it but it was overwhelming in the Torba and must be addressed if more UK guests are to venture here mostly without kids at the end of the season and is noisy not 2 bad at night time I must add. Conclusion would I venture back to this 5 star gaffe with my friends. We paid over 4k for 10 nights but really it‚Äôs only 9 you get with travel times . For 3k I could put up with the negatives and lack of UK guests . Did I enjoy my stay yes most certainly sorry about the honest negative points . This is a real top dollar Hotel with outstanding staff food drinks of the highest quality I have ever seen being served all inclusive Hotel . Satellite needs upgraded to get uk football on very important this traveled to Gumbet 3 times to watch Celtic . Thank you to everyone at the Torba different class cheers üçª cfc",
