I was exceptionally well cared for, especially by the Room Manager Hala, the Receptionists Claudine and Harendra, Salleem in the restaurant with his delicious Turkish coffee, Susette at the Cafe, and the IT Assistant Mohamed Thowfeq. I would like to express my gratitude by naming them specifically, but it wasn't just these individuals; everyone made my stay exceptionally pleasant.",
