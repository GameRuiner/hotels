Great shower.\nLittle kitchen area with tea and coffee facilities. \nDont be put off by the street outside.\nIt's a bit of a scruffy back street but turn left and in two minutes you are in a great lane of cafes and coffee shops.  At the end of that you're right in the middle of the pedestrian street full of shops and restaurants.. \nIf I was being really picky I would ask that they have one English channel on the TV pleaseüòÅ",

There was a paid parking option nearby, so that helped.\n\nThe studio is well furnished and so is the kitchen. Unfortunately, they had started the heating option rather than the AC option which is centralised. Hence, the room was TOO warm for us. It was quite uncomfortable. \nOtherwise, everything was great.\n\nI suggest, they should have a curtain option for the washroom as it is quite transparent when the lights are switched ON inside.",
