The landmarks are in close proximity and old city is about 30 mins away . There are very good quality restaurants within walking distance.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our time in antalya",

It came over from another room, where the reception staff gave the cat shelter. Nice to do, but with negative side effects for the guestsâ€¦",

      "text": "Scoring a mere 3/10, this hotel is a letdown. Front desk service is lackluster, failing even to greet guests, and disregards issues unless significantly disruptive. The sauna underperforms, failing to heat beyond 90 degrees. Bathrooms are hazardous, with a 187cm high metal shower cabinet causing me multiple injuries and a fragile toiletries shelf collapsing under a towel's weight. The bed runner, intended for cleanliness, was neglected. Breakfast disappoints, with limited bread and egg options, substandard pancakes and burek, and an excess of sweet spreads. Electrical issues caused fan noise and flickering service lights. Despite acceptable room service, I discourage recommending this hotel.",
