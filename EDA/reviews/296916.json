Room was clean and had all we needed but bed was very hard. Breakfast was plentiful but selection was small with limited hot selection, pastries and fresh fruit selection. Bar on first floor was small with no real atmosphere. Disappointed that roof top pool and bar was closed (understandable with drought in Spain) but this was not communicated in booking given this was one if the main reasons we booked hotel.
