      "text": "Very enjoyable week. Room was very comfortable, excellent stock of complimentary toiletries and minibar, robe and slippers. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Good range of food in main restaurant buffet and was very tasty, although not a huge variety across the week. We didn't try the al a carte restaurants, but there is a choice if you want to change it up. Lunch time restaurants also open at the beach amd several patisserie stands ipen throughout the day for sweet snacks and icecream.\n\nHighlights\n- Kikoa Kids club is fantastic! 9.30am-midnight, supervised activities for kids of all ages. You can sign children in if you want or the older ones can come and go as they please, almost like a youth club. Lots of great modern facilities including music studio, art studio, play station room and soft play.\n- Lovely coffee hut open through the morning for delicious iced coffees.\n- Pool side and beach cabanas (approx. £110 per day) worth the extra for a treat. Very comfortable, excellent service all day long (cut fruit in the mornings, lunch menus brought to you, and cakes and ice cream in the afternoon)\n- Variety of pool areas mean you can sit in different places every day for a different experience (eg the smaller pools in the trees are much quieter and more relaxing, while the main pool is closest to aqua park for the kids.\n\nDownsides \n- sun loungers nabbed pretty early, even though we were here early in the season. I imagine this only gets worse as the season gets going\n- Evening entertainment pretty limited, but this may be due to it only being start of the season (for example, they didn't open the main amphitheatre while we were here)\n- watch out for jellyfish in the sea! Didn't hear of anyone being stung while we were here, but it meant swimming/paddling in the sea was limited, as we saw quite a few",
