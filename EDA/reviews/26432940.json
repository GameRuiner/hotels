Our employees do their best to provide the best service to our valued guests. We can never accept a situation such as misbehaving or making fun of others.\nAs you mentioned, it is true that our elevator is not working because this elevator is an open-air elevator and it was closed because we thought of you, our guests, as it would be dangerous to operate in a storm. Additionally, our elevator in the main building is operational.\nWith the end of the summer season, our pool was closed to use at the end of October.\nThere are 2 bottles of water available in our rooms as a complimentary service.\nRegarding breakfast, we have difficulty understanding the complaints you make about breakfast without trying our breakfast. Because, as you know, the cooks belonging to your group have prepared breakfast for you. Therefore, if you have any complaints, it would be healthier for you to report it to your own chefs. \n\nEsra GENCER\nGuest Relations \nHoliday Inn Resort\n",
