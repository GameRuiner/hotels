The hotel has a boutique hotel atmosphere, the staff knew my daughter by name and we felt relaxed and well taking care all the time. The location is great. Just a few minutes and you are in the middle of the Boulevard. After an active morning, you can spend a relaxing afternoon at the pool. The restaurant is very nice with a nice variety of options. The restaurant staff were really taking care of us and making an extra mile, we found some new friends there..thank you Florence, Linda, Khaled to be so nice! We definitely would like to visit again.
