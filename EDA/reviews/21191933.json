      "text": "Great apart hotel located directly at Marina Gate Dubai. The studios and apartments are large and offer all the amenities you could wish for. The furnishings are harmonious, color-coordinated and everything is very clean. For people who like to cook their own meals or families with small children, this is a great alternative to the Jumeirah Hotel, which is located in the same block. The breakfast buffet offers a good selection of international dishes and those who want to be active afterwards can do so in the gym with great advice or use one of the pools on the sun deck, where you can also enjoy a wonderful view. All the staff are well trained and very friendly. And a note for amateur chefs, a store with a large display and selection is located in the same block. \nMy last two visits will not be the last, good price for top service!",

There's a reason we come back because it's honestly amazing.\n\nFirst time we came with our daughter who was 4 at the time and they went above and beyond with us and my daughter. Second time we came with our 1 year old and 5 year old at the time. They both loved the hotel. \n\nIts super clean, friendly, breakfast is lovely, they gave an extra cot for my infant and a sofa bed for my older child.\n\nIts right next to the Dubai Marina, walking distance from all shops and restaurants! \n\nWill definitely recommend and come here again!",

      "text": "To start with the positive: \nWe had lovely, personal service from both miss Dayu at the Amara lounge as well as from our house keeper Mr. Yousef. They are keepers! Also the apartment we stayed at was very functional and clean and the pool a nice addition for our family. Location also practical with Carrefour down stairs and direct access to the Marina walk. \n\nHowever, we had several misfortunate encounters during our stay starting from the arriving to the hotel. We arrived late at night with two small children. I had in advance contacted the hotel to ensure the sofa bed is readily made for the kids to go straight to bed. When going up to the room this was not the case. At that point being tired myself as well I went back down to the reception and was visible upset about the situation. The reception sent someone to fix the bed, but none the less it made a delay to the kids bedtime and a bad start to our stay. At no point later during our stay was this mistake addressed again by the hotel staff. \n\nThe whole trip was a surprise to my husband turning 40 during our stay in the hotel. I had informed the hotel also about this in advance asking for restaurant recommendations for his birthday. My son (6 years old) even spontaneously mentioned his dad's birthday to an employee the day before, but came his birthday was it in no way recognized by the hotel. I did not except much, but it would have been common curtesy in my opinion to leave at least a note to the room. Would have been an easy way to delight your customer.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the room was nice and clean, however it was very irritating that although we had booked a room for 4 people we had to all the time request for cutlery, plates and towels for 4 people as the standard equipment level was for 2.\n\nThe reception not once made us feel welcome or recognized us properly when passing by. We ourselves had to look for an eye contact and be the ones to proactively greet the staff at the counter. Once even our two children happily (and loudly) said \"Hi\" to the 3 people behind the reception counter without getting any reply. This is really a point of improvement!\n\nWe will definitely be back to Dubai as a family and even though Jumeirah Living Marina Gate worked well when it comes to facilities, there was plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the hospitality. Thus, we most likely will choose somewhere else to stay.",
