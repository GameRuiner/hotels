      "text": "I booked through Otelz.com, a supposedly reputable company, and arrived at 23:00 after a long flight. The hotel had no reservation for me nor any room. They explained that they don't have any relationship with booking agents; all bookings must be made directly with the hotel. The manager was really helpful; he phoned around and found a room at the nearby Svalinn Hotel at a reduced rate - an excellent hotel. Well done Trio.\nSo I can't give a review of the hotel, but just trying to make sure that nobody else goes through what I went through.",

      "text": "Complaint #1: Their website says it is walking distance to the airport, which is why we chose it. Unless you have the time to walk along the divided highway, you'll have to take a 10-minute cab ride.\nOther issues: A sign at the front desk says all rooms are non-smoking, but this is clearly not enforced as our room smelled like stale smoke. The woman at the desk just shrugged her shoulders at this.\nIf you like shiny, over-the-top decor with topless mermaid table bases, this is the place for you. The lighting was awful -- too low in the bedroom but antiseptically bright in the bathroom. \nThe bathroom was huge but had no shelving to put things, and just one hook.\nIn addition to the smoking and a large empty chip bag, the carpet also had some stains on it and a light bulb was out. A nice man came to check on the light, and apparently had to go shopping to get another bulb. Another man woke us by knocking on our door at 1 a.m., thinking we needed something. We wanted dinner, and the Trio restaurant upstairs was recommended. This was great for breakfast, by the way, but the space was bleak and depressing (all windows, which were black at night), and the food not very good.\nSo sorry I can't recommend, but the least the hotel should do is delete the misleading line that says it's walking distance to the airport.",

      "text": "We stayed at the Trio Hotel for a few days while on business in Izmir. Our double room was relatively clean, with an average sized room with double bed, t.v, wardrobe (with a broken door handle), mini bar and small vanity with a mirror. The bathroom was quite small with the toilet situated right in front of the shower. The choice of lighting was great as there were bright lights as well as bedside ones.\nA big plus for us was that it had free wi-fi in the rooms. It took a little time getting connected but once on remained so for the duration of our stay. \nThe hotel is situated on a main highway with a choice of public transport available nearby. There is a good selection of shops and money machines in the area. We also noticed a few nightclubs in the area but felt relatively safe walking the streets day and night.\nA Turkish style buffet or continental breakfast was available with a selection of teas and a coffee machine. The breakfast room was spacious and had great views out over Gaziemir and beyond. It was situated on the top floor with a lift which seemed to take a long time coming to our floor so we used the stairs.\nStaff were pleasant but most did not speak English which was not a major problem for us as we had other people we could contact locally. Check in and out was relatively easy.\nOne problem we had was that it smelled of smoke which was rather unpleasant as neither of us smoke but can't complain too much about that as we did not bother to ask if another room was available.",
