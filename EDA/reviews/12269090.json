The receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to the King Burj Suite, that actually became a huge playground for our children! They loved running around the main bedroom. All the staff were so kind and helpful, we felt so welcome. We have been to several 5-star hotels and this hotel could easily be in this category. The facilities, the service, and, above all, the experience correspond to a 5-star hotel and not simply to a 4-star one.",

      "text": "We made reservations for Malaysian night on Saturday a couple of weeks before in advance which was something my wife and I had never done before. \nUndoubtedly a striking design, spacious buffet, pleasant atmosphere. \n\nHowever, there weren't many vegetarian options available to us as an Indian, and the food at the buffet was tasteless and crept dessert..(Do not assume that since I am Indian, I am ignorant of dishes. As an FYI, I worked in the hotel industry and particularly  in the F&B department.) \n\nLet's move on. We told a staff member about the situation and asked if they could manage to get one vegetarian dish. When he inquired about our preferences, we mentioned vegetarian biryani. He quickly rejected and offered vegetarian fried rice, which we agreed to.\n\nThe fried rice lacked flavor and was undercooked. We left the rice bowl as it was served and made our way home. The employee inquired about the experience. We informed him that we only relished dessert. He presented the black tea and karak from the buffet. We requested again as to if he could only manage a single latte, please. Yet he nodded his head with “NO”\n\nTherefore, I'm calling our experience \"fake\" because, as a member of the hospitality industry, I know what you could have done but chose not to. And rating here 2 stars for the ambience and dessert.",

To start with, she is really a fan of Doubletree hotels, but this property is exceptional and is now at the top of her list. Their team was very welcoming and accommodating, most especially Hannah. She's very nice and friendly; she welcomed us with her biggest smile, made us feel like very important guests, and made our stay extra special. We have stayed with several Hilton Hotels before, and she is by far the nicest staff we have met.\n\nThe hotel was very clean, their room was very spacious, room service and housekeeping were very responsive, and the location couldn’t be better. There are restaurants and groceries outside the hotel, and the ambience is just really calm and relaxing. \n\nWe just love everything about this hotel, and we will definitely come back and stay longer.",
