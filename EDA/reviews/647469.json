This time in Dubai I wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle of downtown and this retreat was perfect. The pool area was clean and uncrowded. The two lifeguards were very friendly especially Wasinan who  set up my lounger everyday. I had two massages by Siami and I could not recommend her enough. My aches and pains have virtually disappeared and I‚Äôve slept much better since I arrived home. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The person who stood out the most and went the extra mile was Youjan in the bar. His knowledge on wines is extensive and his service and manners were impeccable. I would be so proud if he was a member of my team.  Great stay and I would highly recommend it if you want to relax in the sun and not venture out.",
