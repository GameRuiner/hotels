I have mentioned before how the staff are the best. From beach boys Karim is always there and has been our friend from the begining, he is polite, helpful and friendly. Ibrahim on reception is a very special person to us. There really are too many to mention you all but all the staff make our holiday very special. Thank you all, see you in October ðŸ˜Š",

      "text": "We have just arrived back from another fantastic week at KaiSol Romance. We received a really warm welcome while checking in and were given a beautiful sea view room with a stunning view. \nWe ate at the a la carte restaurants and all were superb ( thank you George and Mohamed for looking after us in the Italian and Indian restaurant) The main buffet restaurant had a huge selection of food and it was all delicious. The staff in there work really hard and are so friendly. Thank you Mary and Roselyn for the Lattes every morning. \nIn the Romance Bar, drinks were  served by Divine and Karim, they were great and we really enjoyed chatting  with them every evening. The waiters from the Landscape Bar worked tirelessly every night serving everyone their drinks, (thank you Tamer and Fayez for keeping our drinks flowing) \nThe beach is stunning,  the sea was crystal clear  and there were always sunbeds available at any time of the day. Kareem and Mohamed,  the lifeguards, are brilliant, putting your towels down and moving your beds for you ( thanks Kareem, I can see through my sunglasses now). On Easter Sunday the hotel stood a giant wooden egg on the beach and Mr Shoukry, the hotel manager invited everyone to decorate it, a musician then played while guests were served an amazing buffet with cocktails. Itâ€™s the extra things like that which makes the KaiSol so special.  \nThis hotel is beautiful, the food is great and ALL staff are so attentive especially Ibrahim who is so caring and helpful ensuring all guests enjoy their holiday - which is why so many people return year after year.",

      "text": "We liked this hotel due to the a la carte restaurants but 2 were being refurbished (although nothing is mentioned on their or any travel website?) leaving only 2 open and basically, they just couldnâ€™t cope. \n\nWe were disappointed with the lack of care regarding food contamination. Nothing is labelled, I couldnâ€™t find much to eat as itâ€™s geared up to meat eaters. Daily there are at least 6-8 meat dishes but nothing vegetarian. Salads are not labelled, soup the same. Very frustrating. They couldnâ€™t even get our packed lunch correct when we went to Luxor. I asked for cheese, my husband chicken. We both got cheese and chicken wrapped up in the same cling film so I couldnâ€™t eat them due to yet more contamination. We were told all kitchen staff are trained regarding basic food hygiene but this wasnâ€™t apparent. I raised the same issues last year and was informed that there was going to be a new vegetarian and plant based menu at the patio bar but of course this hasnâ€™t happened. \n\nVegetarian food should be separate as sometimes utensils by the vegetables had been used by guests for meat and put back covered in sauce, I used to use my own cutlery so I knew it was clean.\n\nTowels were threadbare, sheets were old and bobbling, I wouldnâ€™t use them for my cat! Cracked sink in bathroom, nowhere to hang towels coming out of the shower. Drinks pretty bad. The hotel ran out of vodka, gin, juice for 24 hours, the replacements were un drinkable. We went next door for a decent drink in the end. \n\nWaiters were clueless, especially at the patio cafe. Youâ€™d order and theyâ€™d forget or bring the wrong drink. The pool we gave up and got our own drinks from the beach bar as the waiter by the pool only served people who tipped him. We were ignored first over an hour. Finally got a flat lager then just walked to the pool bar, didnâ€™t bother with the pool again. \n\nThe lobby bar was our go to bar prior to dinner and after but again, you waited ages for a drink while people who came after us got served. We gave up ordering drinks so stood at the bar otherwise you didnâ€™t get served. \n\nTrying to get a drink or a coffee in the main buffet took far too long. The waitresses were running around but were seriously understaffed. Why not have a drinks section so you can make your own coffee? This would free up the staff to do their jobs more efficiently. Waiters were too busy clearing and setting up tables but missing side plates, napkins, water etc. \n\nThe buffet is laid out strangely. The egg station is directly in the centre so there is a bottle neck trying to get to either side of the buffet. Getting porridge in a morning was a trial as the bowls were one side, the porridge in the middle next to the chips and meat? Why? Last year was better. The honey was the complete opposite end as was the cinnamon and not a blueberry or raspberry in sight. \n\nPool tiles missing, in need of a lot of repair work. You only get decent service if you tip heavily or daily which is disgraceful. On day one we tipped the beach guy and we had front row, second day on the second row, by the end of the week we were by the bins. We hoped this hotel had improved on last year as is had potential and thought it may become a bit more upmarket and boutique, sadly it has gone downhill and now caters for the masses who want quantity not quality. The staff are lovely but are running around like headless chickens while management strut around not doing a great deal. George, Ana and Jocelyn were wonderful but too busy to talk to. \n\nSheraton or Savoy for us next time.",

      "text": "Nice property, a little out of the way so no external nightlife but with everything you would expect from a upper mid range traditional all inclusive.\nRooms are good and clean if a little tired, pool strangely set behind the hotel but the beach is  just across the (pedestrianised) road and there are plenty of loungers and good beach services.\nFood is essentially buffet and of good quality. \nThe a la carte restaurants are small and only 4 were open when we were there. You need to pre book or visit the concierge on arrival for something a little different to the standard buffet.\nDrinks plentiful but frankly to the European palette local alcohol is \"not quite right!\"\nUltra all inclusive Ikos it isn't, but it is a good safe 4 star option .",
