Between Sue and Alice at the two connected properties this place will always be home from home.  They always remember a face and go out of their way to make the stay the best they can. \n\nThese ladies are a credit to the brand and the property and I highly recommend staying with them.  \n\nThe building itself is great and in a lovely part of town.  Nice access to the creek.  Pool is pleasant and food isnâ€™t excessive for hotel pricing.",

      "text": "Stayed for 3 nights with my two children.  This is a lovely modern hotel in the Dubai Creek area.  We chose this as it was not too far from the airport (we arrived in the early hours of the morning) and was conveniently located for the metro (10-15min walk to Bur Juman metro station) which we used to travel to the Museum of the Future and the Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall areas.  We booked a family room which turned out to be two connecting rooms - one with a king double and another with two smaller doubles.  The rooms were clean and modern and very comfortable.  The buffet breakfast was excellent with a good choice of dishes with European, Asian and Arabic options.  As it was Ramadan there was an Iftar buffet in the evening which we had once and was also excellent.  The rooftop pool area was a lovely place to relax and we enjoyed some drinks and snacks from the bar here too. All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  My only real complaint is that smoking is allowed in the area around the pool - despite being outside it is still a confined area and it was unpleasant relaxing by the pool with someone smoking a couple of metres away.",
