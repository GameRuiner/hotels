      "text": "Not a bad stay by any stretch, however the photos possibly over glamorise the primitive decor and basic amenities here. What we thought would be quite a modern and chic looking hotel is actually quite cheaply done when looked at close-up. The staff weren’t really that engaging and the location of the hotel is in an area of Barcelona that many reviews and travel experts recommend is avoided owing to its crime. In actual fact we didn’t find the area that much of a problem. I think it probably gets a bad rap owing to the immigrant community, however we found everyone delightful and welcoming. The pool was closed during our entire stay there, which was a disappointment as there were some quite nice days when we would’ve liked to have enjoyed it.",

The hotel is very secure, clean and friendly and is a perfect location for the centre of Barcelona at a super reasonable price. The pool area is lovely to relax after a long day of walking and the breakfast is minimal but great. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Staff are lovely and friendly from reception, house keeping and breakfast.",

Initially we were given wrong room number but was quickly sorted for us. Our room was clean and spacious and had everything we needed during our short visit to Barcelona. Air con didn't work the first night but after speaking with reception, this was quickly fixed. Location was brilliant. 5 mins max to Las Ramblas and 15 mins to El Born area that is full of great bars, cafes, restaurants and shops. Breakfast had an excellent range and was delicious\n\nWould definitely recommend this hotel.",
