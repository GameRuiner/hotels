      "text": "It was our second time at the hotel. Great location. Easy to get to most places either on foot or by metro. Lots of restaurants on Las Ramblas and in the area. Lovely room on the 18th floor. Great beds and pillows and it was so quiet I slept so welll. The level is great with lots of lovely tapas, beer and cava and soft drinks from lunch time until 10. We had breakfast there most days too. I would like to especially mention Julia who checked us in with a lovely glass of cava. She really went above and beyond helping us and recommended a fantastic tapas bar, I think it was Kalamata that had huge portions of great tapas ( I wouldn't order more than 4, you will not need them unless you are really hungry - even the waitress warned me the 6 we ordered were too many for 2 people but they were all fabulous. I also highly recommend the tortilla at the level which is the best I have had. Fedrico the chef was so lovely. He gave us a book his mum had written when we left and he illustrated which is a lovely memento of our trip. It really is a fabulous hotel and we hope to be back soon.",

      "text": "We stayed January 7-12, 2024. I had a Junior Suite at the Level, my friend had a regular room on the 11th floor. The Level is a great experience & worth the extra, mainly due to the lounge. Antonio was great with tours & just any inquires and making dinner reservations. \n\nBreakfast was fantastic.  I said to my friend, \"this is like being on a cruise ship.\"  Hopefully, this explains to you the breakfast experience. Cook to order eggs, including egg benedict, scrambled eggs, meats, pastries, fresh juices, breads, and fruit. \n\nThe room was clean, there were some scrapes and gaps in places along the flooring or wall. Nothing concerning. The shower was a double rain shower with a double hand held spray nozzle. The provided soaps, shampoo, and conditioner were good.  The bath towels are huge and the Junior Suite came with bath robes. \n\nThe room is cleaned each day and two cans of water are provided in the room rate. Anything in the min-fridge or the snacks are extra. There is safe in the room.\n\nThe one aggravating factor for me was, both bathroom sinks were slow to drain.  I was not able to have this repaired during my stay even though I worked through Antonio to get this done. \n\nThe hotel restaurant has adequate offerings, the bartenders Pablo and Andrea are simply some of the best. Their drinks were great and they were happy to try to make new drinks.  Very fun experience with them, especially Pablo. \n\nThe Level in on floor 25 and this is for check-in and check-out. Plus, the Level lounge is located here too. Cava, Wine, and beer are offered during the hours of operation. However, from 5:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. pour your own liquor is offered. Food offerings are sandwiches, meats, cheeses, pastries, soda's, nuts, etc. \n\nWould I stay here again. Yes and without hesitation. Would I pay to stay at the Level?  I'm not sure this was worth the surcharge of several hundred USD over 5 days.",
