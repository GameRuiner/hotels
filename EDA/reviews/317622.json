      "text": "We (mom dad and sons 16 and 20) are on the last day of our weeks stay at Sun Beach Resort. We booked a 1 bedroom sea view premium room which was on the top floor over looking the Dionysus pool and the sea. The room is very large and comfortable with a huge comfortable bed in the bedroom and two sofa beds in the lounge which our sons have been very happy with. The kitchen is basic but well equipped with everything we’ve needed. Everything in the hotel is very clean. We’ve  used room service and order to your sun-bed a couple of times which worked well and the food was very good. When we first arrived it was very quiet and not many things were open but now the hotel is pretty much full and everything is opening up in the resort as well as the hotel. We have mostly eaten in local restaurants (highly recommend Casa Italia, Stefanos and Tsaperdona). Little supermarket opposite the hotel is good for basics and the staff are lovely and happy to help. In fact all the staff have been wonderful. Special shout out to Michael in the Thalassa bar/restaurant where we went for cocktails to watch the amazing sunset in the evenings (especially recommend the Mango of Desire and Tropical Marmelade) - Excellent service and great spot which is quiet because most people are all inclusive it seems. \nWe hired a car from the hotel reception and again the service was brilliant and price reasonable. We drove to Lindos, Rhodes Town, Kalithea and Anthony Quinn bay. Also did a boat trip to Symi which we really enjoyed. We’ve had a great week and have been very lucky with the weather although the pools and sea are still quite cold as it’s still very early in the season.  The Azure adult pool is amazing next to the sea and very peaceful though windy at times. We didn’t use the garden pool and only went over to that side to play table tennis. It looked very nice though.  Planes do go over at intervals but it’s not bothered us at all - they’re gone in seconds. Overall very happy and hope to come back.",

      "text": "Me and my partner had an amazing stay at this hotel. We only booked for a week but we wished we stayed longer. \n\nThe hotel is about a 15-20 minute cab journey from the airport. As the hotel is so close to the airport, you do see a lot of planes fly over. This wasn't a problem for me or my partner, we actually made it into a drinking game. But this is something definitely to be aware of as it can be quite loud.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were happy to find out we had been upgraded to a studio room with sea views! We originally booked a standard garden view room but the sea view was incredible! I would definitely recommend booking a sea view as it really made such a difference and it is a stunning view from the balcony. The room was overall was in immaculate condition and it was nice to have the option of cooking facilities. \n\nLoved the beachfront, spent most of our days sunbathing there as it was much more quiet and relaxing than around the pool. It is 5 euros a day per person for a sun bed. The only downfall of being on the beach is there is not a beach bar you can go to for drinks. The sea is very rocky as we expected so would recommend some water shoes. The adults only pool section looked stunning but we never sat over there and I believe this was 10 euros per day per person. \n\nThis hotel has two buildings so one is by the beachfront and the other is across the road (not far at all!). The building across the road is where you eat your lunch and dinner, have the evening entertainment and another pool over there. The food was ok, like any all inclusive really. It had lots of different options so there was always something you'd like. Although, some nights were quite fish heavy. We really enjoyed the breakfast because you could sit by the sea and eat this. \n\nWe rented a car for 3 days and drove around the island. The car rental within the hotel is great and really good value! I think we paid 90 or 100 euros for a brand new Polo.\n\nRhodes city is about a 15 minute drive so you can get a cheap cab there. Walking distance from the hotel is plenty of restaurants and bars, so if you aren't all inclusive or fancy going out for dinner there is lots of places. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. If I went back to Rhodes, I would definitely stay again. ",

The problems encountered were - 1) despite booking in February 2023 for a holiday in September 2023 we did not get the two rooms booked but were given what they deemed an upgrade but it was a self catering one bedroom apartment with a further bed in the kitchen area with one bathroom and a further shower room - if we wanted to share a room we could have booked this apartment and probably saved several hundred pounds. We had to accept this so called upgrade because we were told the hotel was full!!  2) Despite booking all inclusive there were only certain areas that offered food and certain areas treating us differently for drinks - for example we would sit at a table and were ignored but if other persons paying on the day sat at a table they were served immediately with drinks and food - we obtained our own food and drinks.",
