      "text": "Where to begin! This hotel and it’s staff have everything a 5* All Inclusive could ever need. We were given an instant room upgrade when we arrived at the hotel, to a room with a much clearer view of the lagoon. The room (629) was very clean and spacious with plenty of storage for luggage as well as a fully stocked mini fridge which was kindly topped up everyday by housekeeping. \n\nThe variety of food was fantastic and very nicely prepared. The buffet had a lovely spread every morning and evening. We didn’t make it there for lunch as we went to Yades beside the lagoon most lunches. We highly recommend Yades (the Greek restaurant) specifically the lamb main and Mangal (the Turkish BBQ restaurant) where you choose your meat from the counter and it is then brought to you in the beautiful picnic setting. \n\nThe Lagoon was beautiful. Always plenty of beds and such friendly staff. Big shout out to Mohamed Mahmoud and Ahmed Abdeen who made every visit to the beach so relaxing from constantly topping up our drinks to shuffling our beds into the sun as it moved in the day. What exceptional service. Another lovely touch is the book libraries that are placed at the towel sheds where you can exchange the book you have read for a new one. \n\nFor the avid snorkelers, theres not much wildlife to see in the lagoon itself except for a tiny rock reef in the far left corner towards the platform beds, however if you walk 10 minutes to the neighbouring hotels jetty there is a magnificent reef there teeming with life from Puffer Fish, Clams, Box Fish, Butterfly Fish and the occasional Lion Fish. And if there are any divers reading this, I can recommend New Son Bijou as a diving company to book with. Fantastic dive sites, safe small dive groups and at a great price. \n\nYou are given towel cards that you can swap out for large beach towels at the towel stations around the hotel and are able to swap your wet towels out for dry towels whenever you need. You can also take a red flag from the towel stations which you pop near your beds to tell the hotels masseurs and restaurant reps that you do not wish to be disturbed. There is a lovely tea/coffee shop next to the buffet area where you can get lovely little sweet treats and ice cream too! And in the bar next to reception they hold an afternoon tea with finger sandwiches and sweet treats too!\n\nA tip for shopping. Do not use the shopping strip across the road from the hotel as they will charge you above and beyond for items. If you walk 10 minutes down the road there is a big shopping mall with restaurants and supermarkets which are much more affordable. \n\nMakram our TUI rep was absolutely phenomenal. Always on hand to help and so good at explaining things clearly and concisely. And something that I absolutely cannot forgot to mention are the gardens. The time and attention the hotel groundskeepers put into the beautiful flowers, shrubs, trees and grass is second to none. Every day we witnessed the care and love they had for maintaining the gorgeous gardens. Truly unsung heros at this resort!\n\nOverall, the 10 days we spent in this resort ending up with neither of us wanting to leave. The staff were always on hand to help and the facilities were incredible. We can’t wait to return!",

      "text": "First time to this hotel and indeed Hurghada. Didn’t venture out as we wanted a complete break and rest and that’s exactly what we got. Couldn’t quite work the place out initially. There’s something missing but still can’t put my finger on it. Maybe the atmosphere but we had a really lovely time. \nThe good bits: Beautiful gardens, spotlessly clean, well equipped rooms, good variety and choice of restaurants. \nThe less good bits: some of the staff were not very friendly, often seemed hassled, particularly at the pool bar. Plastic cups round the pool were filthy and often the bars ran out of glassware, resulting in literally a 5 second wash in the dishwasher (no wonder several people report being sick). There is a sunbed policy which states towels will be removed if you ‘dump and run’ and don’t return within the hour. This isn’t ever enforced meaning by 7am during the busy Easter period, many of the nicer located beds had gone but no sign of the users til gone 11. Rude. Sunbeds themselves are really uncomfortable. The evening ‘entertainment’ is not entertaining. A different singer each night that couldn’t hold a note for toffee, bleating out the same tunes every night so the entertainment staff could do a couple of lousy dance routines, again the same. Every. Single. Night. \nI’d go back. Not in a rush but would return. Wouldn’t say it was 5* but pleasant",

I am so glad we did as we had a fabulous holiday at this lovely resort. Our pool view room was spacious and comfortable with a nice terrace to sit outside with a 🍸. The whole resort has beautiful gardens which are groomed to perfection.  We'll done gardeners! Lots of loungers by the pool and the beach. The hotel never felt crowded. Lovely choice of restaurants so we tried them all. Indian was my favourite with great curries and a very attentive manager and waiters. Thank you. All of the food choices we made in 14 days were well cooked and very enjoyable. Very relaxing bar and plenty of cocktails to try. All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful. Special mention to Faris in the restaurant.,Peter in animation  who was so funny and interesting to talk to ( good luck at university!) Also Muhammad in the Indian restaurant.

      "text": "Sorry for late ish review.\nStayed early March.for the 7th time. Everything as beautiful as always\nGrounds amazing. Well done guys.!!\nRooms immaculate.Again as always!\nFood , excellent!! In all the a la cartes!.\nDid Indian 5 times in 14 nights (Always been our favourite). Ahmed ,Mohamed Ali and the rest of the staff , you do an amazing job of making everyone sooo welcome…. 5 STARS BOYS.!!\nKhalid in the Egyptian restaurant.Thank you for wonderful service.again 5 stars!!\nOnly negative on the restaurants . “Yades” it’s been so wonderfully upgraded from what was The Poseidon (think that’s what it was called). It has very little atmosphere , probably on how far apart everyone sits whilst eating their meal. Food excellent though.\nBar staff everywhere did a great job \nLifeguards at beach … again really good service, never far away when things need doing.\nAnimation team.. Sou ! Really enjoyed speaking everyday. Peter ! You’re a wonderfully talented man knowing how to make everyone happy all day/night.\n“Mad Professor” my wife called you in your bow tie. 😂  Also , the breakdancing guys..WOW!! Amazing!!\nAll the guys on reception. Your friendly professional service never ceases to amaze. Thank you so much.\nVery lastly.. Thank you Catherine ,Laura and again Peter for  not only being great guest relations , but also  wonderful people. Again. Had great conversations most evenings.. Sorry!!\nIt was a wonderful Holiday amongst what we class as friends..\nThank you all for making us feel so welcome on our return.\nWe look forward to returning sometime very soon.",
