      "text": "My wife and I have just returned from a ten night holiday at this lovely hotel. I’ll start off with a couple of slight negatives, so that I can then concentrate on the many positives!\nWe were a bit disappointed with the dining experience. We used to eat between 8-8.30pm, and usually had difficulty in finding a table. When we did find a table, we then had to find a waiter to set our table, or even grab some cutlery and set if ourselves. We used to get our own drink too, as there simply wasn’t enough staff around to serve us. In other 5 star hotels that we have stayed at, we have been greeted at the entrance to the dining area, shown to a set table, and then a drinks order taken straight away, so it was somewhat disappointing that we didn’t get such service.\nThe other point was the entertainment area for the evening shows. Quite simply, the space was too small, and so we were often left standing at the back as there weren’t enough seats available. However, the excellent waiter working in the area always tried to find us a chair or table as soon as he could!\n\nOk, enough of the negatives! This hotel is beautifully set out and a big space. The views are stunning, and there are a number of pools to choose from, as well as the beach. We used to go to the Island pool area, and were superbly looked after by the towel team and the waiters. However, my positive comments about the staff apply to all staff - they were fantastic, friendly and efficient. The vast majority of guests were Russian, and although they didn’t cause us a problem, the resort definitely lacked the feel of warmth and friendliness that you usually get on holiday. It was therefore very welcoming to have such warm and friendly staff!\nWe used to eat our lunch in the pool bar, and they offered a nice selection of food, which was freshly cooked. Once again, the staff were amazing, and we got to know them well over the holiday. I used to go snorkelling most days, and there was always plenty to see along the reef.\nOur room was spacious and kept beautifully clean ( thanks Ahmed), and we always had a good nights sleep. \nIt is quite a steep slope ( or many steps) from the bottom of the resort to the top, but there was a regular shuttle service that did a circuit, and so the longest you would wait would be 5 mins - and we were very grateful for this service after a long day in the sun! Other than my couple of comments at the beginning of this review, I really couldn’t fault this lovely hotel. Our daytime experience was always perfect, and only had a bit of an issue with the evening experience - but we coped!\nThank you to on the wonderful staff for making our holiday such a happy memory.\n\nJust as a footnote , unfortunately, our homeward bound experience was awful, and so if you are not familiar with Sharm airport, then this might be useful. I’m all for security at airports, but I had my bags scanned three times, and was frisked, made to empty my pockets, take off shoes and belt three times in the space of 45 minutes, as did many other people. The staff were rude, verging on aggressive, and I have never felt so violated. Trying to get our bags checked in was a complete shambles, and none of the staff seemed to know that was going on, and were just shouting at each other. Ironically, suitcases were left abandoned all over the place, which makes a mockery of their so called tight security! \n\nWe would love to return to this lovely hotel, but based on our dreadful airport experience ( and it was many other people too) we won’t be returning to Sharm anytime soon. Such a shame.",

      "text": "Having previously stayed at the sunrise arabian and having such a wonderful time, my hopes were high for this hotel, although very nice, little things kinda spoilt our experience.\nUpon check in we were left sitting for a long time before anyone came to give us the room key, not the best of starts, but once we were sorted we were whisked to our swim up room and the initail concerns were alleviated, the room was nice, fresh and clean, and the pool was so warm as they are heated in the winter months, so absolutely no complaints about the room, fluffy towels, robes, slippers and a full mini bar with soft drinks and beer which is refilled daily.\n\nThe food in the hotel is hit or miss in my opinion, there is always something to eat but the layout is poor and is more like a school dining area, it is always manic and i now realise that our red friends do not have any manners and push in and take far too much that they eventually leave, this is not by any means only them but it kinda spoilt the buffet restaurant experience.\nThe lobby bar is beside the buffet restaurant and sometimes is a chore constantly queuing for a drink, and on that note can i mention that in my opinion the alcohol is watered down, as neither me or my wife could get drunk no matter how much we drank. We are currently hotel hopping and we are not having this problem at any of the other resorts we are staying at.\nThe a la catre restaurants are on a whole very good, the italian is like a refectory and has no atmosphere, its too bright and does not give a romantic atmosphere, and i have to add the only miserable member of staff i came across in the resort works here, it seemed like we were asking for the world when asking for a wine, which eventually arrived after we had finished our starter, however the food was nice.\nThe beach bbq meal was fantastic as was the chimchurri steak restaurant. And the staff and waiters were outstanding and so helpful.\nThe beach is barren and snorkelling anywhere apart from off the end of the jetty is poor.\nThe main issue i had with this hotel was the location of the animation everyday and the timing of the booming music, as our room was onnthe sea front it was impossible to get any rest, especiallu if you wanted an afternoon snooze as everyday the booming music started about 3, this is a deal breaker for me and i wont be back. I dont mind loud music or people having fun but i break at some stage of the day would have been welcome. There is also a member of the animation team that makes the most annoying whoop whoop noise every five minutes which honestly was driving me insane. \n\nSo in conclusion, the hotel is very good, the swim up room was superb, the a la carte restaurants were superb in general, the grounds are so well maintained but also the lack of anywhere to get an drink down at the lower pools after 5 is a huge miss, not everyone wants to go upto the main lobby bar building at night, this seemed like a common complaint from other guests i spoke too.\n\nCould very easily be a good 5 star hotel but until these things are dealt with it will remain only 4 in my view ",
