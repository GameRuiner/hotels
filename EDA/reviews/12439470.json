      "text": "I‚Äôm genuinely baffled by the reviews raving about the food, and I‚Äôm far from being a snob or fussy eater! \n\nI‚Äôll start by stating that none of the family good ill from the food, but in terms of quality, variety and taste it was average at the very best. \n\nWe stayed at Rixos Seagate last year but decided to go for Pickalbatros at the end of March this year for the aqua park, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint in this respect. Great variety of pools and slides suitable for all ages. \n\nHowever we have realised that even with the relatively insignificant price difference you certainly get what you paid for, and in this instance not in a good way. \n\nJuices were in the form of concentrated cartons in a caddy bag to pour yourself, ‚Äòfreshly squeezed‚Äô orange juice was so diluted it may as well have been ‚Äòa touch of fruit‚Äô, and even fairly standard breakfast buffet items such as scrambled eggs were only available on request, which resulted in long queues at the omelette station. Mini-bar only ever stocked with water, and beers served in glasses so small you felt embarrassed having to ask for 3 at a time just to make half a pint. \n\nFood variety itself was very limited, with a subtle change of only 2-3 dishes each evening with all the rest remaining the same. \n\nIf you‚Äôre not too fussed about the food and drink choices then this would be a decent hotel at a reasonable price. But for us it was unfortunately a deal breaker, echoed by a number of other brits we met there.",
