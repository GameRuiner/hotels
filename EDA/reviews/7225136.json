      "text": "This hotel is absolutely terrible, dirty, smelly and rundown. We booked a non-smoking room which does not exist in this hotel, it is a smoking hotel and everywhere stinks enough to give you an instant headache. The staff was rude, not accommodating when we asked for a different room that was actually non-smoking, argumentative when we pointed out the false advertising, very unhelpful and took 0 ownership. I would highly recommend against staying here, there are plenty other hotels in the area that would be better options. This hotel is definitely not suitable for children or families. ",

The guy who helped us with luggage was very nice and helpful and told us, that breakfasts included... All other staff was really nice and helpful . Situated near railway station, but with my husband I felt safety walking in the late evening. Breakfast was ok, bed linen clean, in the room quite clean.",
