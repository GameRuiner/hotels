      "text": "I noticed I didn't have money in the place I put it (in my room) and thought I lost it. Until friend in another room told me she is missing some money too. Another friend in another room found her purse left open. \n\nGuess who had the access to our rooms?\n\nI don't make accusations easily but too many factors show somebody took our money from the rooms and this made our stay in Armis Hotel a bad experience. \n\nThe organisation I was with said they will take care of that but I don't think this problem even reached the reception. So it is also my fault I didn't take this into my hands. I can only hope this review will do it.",

Within a few minutes of checking in I was escorted to my room which was clean and modern and exactly as advertised. \nThe room had all the usual facilities such as TV, WIFI, Mini bar etc and all was accessed without a hitch. If anything, wifi signal could be a bit stronger but overall it was OK. Breakfast was great with a huge selection of food to suit all appetites and the room service menu was also great!\nStaff was always very friendly and ready to assist. Being a smoker, there was also an enclosed smoking area where one can enjoy their coffee without annoying other guests. Overall a great hotel and I would highly recommend to anyone.",
