      "text": "This was my second stay at Hampton by Hilton Dubai Al Barsha, and, just like the first time, the hotel not only did not disappoint, but it turned out to be the best choice. I even noticed a few improvements in certain areas, like for example the wonderful smell in the lobby and the halls, the quality of the bathroom amenities or the filtered water system in the room. Also, it is worth mentioning the top-notch breakfast and the extremely comfortable bed. Special thanks to Dee from the reception - one of the kindest persons I have ever met. She was so nice in helping us with an early check-in, giving us very useful information, making sure we had everything we needed, and always greeting us with a big smile when we crossed paths in the lobby.\nConsidering that I have been to 5-star hotels that did not even come close to the standard of Hampton Al Barsha, I fully recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dubai!",
