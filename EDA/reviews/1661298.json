      "text": "Must be our 12th stay. We love it here, as its just a small boutique hotel with 22 rooms therefore all the staff treat us as friends and make us feel so valued. The rooms are a great size, spotlessly clean, serviced twice a day with huge comfy beds ( we prefer a golf course view, 114 is our favourite). The Spa is great and Pauline always helps us get our treatments booked, we found Lisa to give fantastic massages. The pool is never busy and the guys always make sure you have plenty water and towels. My husband played golf and the course was in excellent condition. Breakfast in Montys is a delight and evening drinks especially sitting outside is great, all the team look after us. Big shout out to Ali and Sultan who just want to ensure your holiday goes without any problem and it was lovely to see Delsey on the desk for our arrival. There is some building work going on next to the pool, they ate building a coffee bar, but it didn't impact too much on our stay. Thank you and see you all again soon. ",

      "text": "Maybe our 11th stay now and we never tire of staying here. As it is only a small hotel with about 22 rooms, everyone remembers you and treats you like a friend. Easy check in from Delsey and taken to our room ( 116) with views of the skyline and golf course. Rooms are a good size with huge comfy beds, spotlessly clean with everything you need, great job from housekeeping. The guys at the pool look after you, checking you have plenty water ( it's kept in a cool box) and towels. Monty's is great for a drink or food, the nachos are great and all the staff remember what you drink, they anticipate your needs. Big shout out to Ali, he treats us like family, checks we have everything we need, and also Sultan who we have got to know. Great Hotel if you like golf but The Spa does great treatments,  I managed 2 in 6 days! We just love it here and can't wait to come back....thanks once again to everyone. See you soon.",

It was only on the way home that I immediately felt unwell  and thank fully didn't have too far to go as for the next 24hours I was very unwell, which ruined the end of the holiday.                                        \nI complained but Munish sent emails saying it couldn't have been the chicken as no one else complained! This  is rubbish as anyone knows just a small amount of chicken with salmonella will cause the reaction I had. I also only had cereal and a banana all day. \n Very disappointed  in them and will not eat there again! Costly night for me is many ways.",
