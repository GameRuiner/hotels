We absolutely loved this hotel!\nFrom the aesthetics to the vibe to the cleanliness to the service, everything was spectacular!\nUpon check-in, we were upgraded to a water view vs downtown view and it was a really gorgeous view.\nThe family suite was perfect for our family of 4 and even had an extra half bath! The bedding was super comfy and main bathroom was beautiful with a large standing shower and separate giant tub.\nThe breakfast buffet was an incredible layout and the food was really delicious! We had breakfast included in our reservation and would recommend it. You can also order off a menu if you want.\nWe were only in Dubai for 1.5 days and spent most of our time at the Dubai Mall and the Burj and both are easily walkable from the hotel. \nWe also visited the rooftop outdoor lounge for some hookah and that was also a very fun experience!\nLoved this hotel a lot and can‚Äôt wait to go back or stay at another location!!",
