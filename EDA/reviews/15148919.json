      "text": "My sister and I stayed at the Grand Millennium for 2 nights before heading to the Seychelles. The service was outstanding from the minute we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped off at the airport. The staff at the Grand Millennium go way beyond the call of duty to make your stay the very best it can be. They are incredibly friendly, helpful and professional. We had chauffer service from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel back to the airport. We also had a chauffer take us to Abu Dhabi for the day. Everything went very smoothly. \n\nOur rooms were upgraded. Both rooms were spacious, the beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of lounging space (work desk/chair and chairs/table). The bathrooms were spacious as well.\n\nMy sister and I thought the buffet breakfast was great. There was a lot of food choices (both hot and cold). We had dinner at Asia Asia which was good too. It was a nice atmosphere by the river. We also ordered room service one night which was fast and great.\n\nI would definitely stay there again!",

      "text": "Excellent 5-star hotel in Dubai, located in one of the best areas - Business Bay. Perfect if you are coming by car - excellent valet services and ample parking space. All the staff was friendly, attentive, polite and helpful, and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The services are great (e.g., We used the laundry service which was reasonably priced and timely, or the reception was always helpful with anything we needed). Hotel itself is new, very modern and tastefully decorated, with large lobby spaces to hangout. Room had a view of the bay and Burj Khalifa. Room was very spacious, clean and well equipped. Amenities include chairs, tables, desk, windows with sun blinds, smart TV, powerful air-conditioning, mirror, plenty of closet space with hangers, safe, fridge, tea kettle, tea & coffee, USB charging sockets and lamps on both sides of the bed, great lighting, fast Wi-Fi, iron, shoe horn, hair dryer, and essentials like towels, shampoo, shower gel, etc. Bed and blankets were large. Mattress was very comfortable (also for people with back problems). Bathroom was spacious, well-designed and clean, with a bathtub, walk-in shower, bidet, toilet and vanity mirror. Breakfast was just delicious, with every variety of food imaginable. Staff was attentive and careful about allergies and special dietary requirements. Hotel has four in-house restaurants and a bar to choose from, all of which are excellent. One of the restaurants has their own sheesha place with excellent sheeshas and service. Hotel has a decent swimming pool with a life guard on duty and a pool-side bar with nice views. Spa (includes jacuzzi, steam, sauna, etc.) was well-maintained and massage services were excellent. In general, one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in! The only negatives: Fridge was not cooling enough. Location of hotel is difficult to reach by public transportation (e.g., metro).",
