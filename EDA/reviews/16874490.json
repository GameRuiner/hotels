      "text": "Tried to book online which failed due to the agent not accepting cards so just turned up! \nNight staff very helpful and welcoming. Paid cash as requested. Room on 3rd floor, lift would have health and safety in the UK running for the rule book but perfectly acceptable for those of a sensible disposition! \nThe room itself warm clean, bed comfortable and warm, plenty of hot water. Minor critisism would be towels were only bath towels rather than bath sheet but they were clean too.\nTea and coffee were free. Wifi good access. As this was very much a last minute stay I did not have a phone charger with me so reception lent one to give the phone a boost. \nBreakfast was an option but we did not try this instead choosing to walk to a small cafe to eat. \nWe would have no hesitation in returning. A very reasonably priced hotel and recommended.",
