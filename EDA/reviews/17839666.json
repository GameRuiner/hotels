      "text": "Excellent stay at the Delta. Firstly the staff were so friendly, helpful and they couldn't do enough to ensure you had a fantastic stay.\nThe room was spacious and we were delighted when our request for a balcony room was met, this made our holiday extra special.\nThe food at the hotel was lovely and the restaurant staff were brilliant. Stefany was so kind always finding us a nice table. The views from the roof terrace are lovely.\nIt was sometimes busy but the staff worked so hard to ensure that you had everything you needed. On our last day we even had a happy journey cake which was a lovely gesture.\nThe location of the hotel was perfect for us. Located between the beach and the marina and only a 5 minute walk from both. The hotel provides towels and umbrellas for your visit to the beach. You can also pay for sunbeds on the beach from a private company and there is a massive inflatable aqua park in the sea which my son enjoyed.\nI will definitely stay at the Delta again on any future trips to Dubai.",

There was a tasty range of different varieties for breakfast. Thank you to Chef Vaishaark, who would always check up on my grandmother to see if she had gotten her Indian breakfast, which was kindly made, as she is a pure vegetarian. All the staff at Delta Hotel are excellent and accommodating—a special shoutout to Umang and Payiush, who are helpful and friendly to us every morning. Our housekeeper, Joane, was very polite and made our stay more comfortable. \nDelta Hotel made our stay feel special, and I recommend this hotel for your stay in Dubai.",
