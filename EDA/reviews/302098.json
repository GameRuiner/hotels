The food on site was good and the service was always helpful and polite from all staff, from the bellhop to the front desk and everyone else.\n\nThe bed was comfy (maybe a little on the soft side) and internet was sufficiently fast (and free).\n\nThe view from the outdoor deck (that can be closed for private events, I think) on the 42 floor is really the best part, though. Great views all around, but especially of the Burj Khalifa.\n\nDespite being close to that and the mall, it was surprisingly hard to walk to given the big roads and interchange in the way. I did it once and it took ~40 minutes. The train will get you there, but it also will take you 30 probably. A cab took maybe 15 because of the zig zag needed.",
