      "text": "Being a \"residence\" I'm of the opinion that the apartment could be a bit better furnished (sofa quite tired) and the kitchen a bit better equipped (limited pots and pans). The complimentary water bottles could be supplied in bigger quantities and size as this is a hot country where you usually have to drink quite much due to the heat (especially being a foreigner from Nordic countries), and it's quite rudimentary and low cost to supply for someone commiting to a longterm stay. The TV's chromecast connection works poorly, so it's a struggle to get Neflix going. Luckily it works after some hustle...\n\nAnyway, I have chosen to extend my stay at this place (multiple months in Dubai for work) and a big reason is the nice personnel doing room service (cleaning) and the friendly rescue/service peopl at the pool. The location is quite good with walking distance to many basic needs (waitrose, marina walk, good restaurants). Unfortunately the highway is a bit busy and right beside the building.\nThere are adequate fitness spaces for amateur workouts. If they had a heavy barbell and rack I would have everything I needed personally. The 15 meter pool works well for shorter swims as complimentary and easy exercise.\nOtherwise the pool area is quite basic, but a good place to relax at.\n\nOverall I think I will enjoy living in this place. How the parking place and traffic availability works remains to be seen as I have not yet started renting a car.",
