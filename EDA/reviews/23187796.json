      "text": "Unfortunately our holiday started on the wrong foot with this hotel, although it was our 4th holiday at a Rixos and expected to experience the same high standards as we’ve previously had.\n\nAfter waiting more than 3 hours to be checked in - with our 1 year baby and my 72 years old father, the guest relationship manager (Mr Emad) told us that the real reason for which they don’t give us our rooms is that the hotel didn’t receive the money from the local travel agency - although we have paid in full 1 month prior.\n\nWe’ve explained that we have paid, that we booked through a big travel agency - long story short, our travel agency seemed to have paid to the Egyptian one, but that local agency allegedly didn’t pay to the hotel.\n\nWe were in shock, and asked what should we do - leave the hotel and search for accommodation in Hurghada? Of course they were aware they will receive the money, admitting the local agency is one of the biggest they have in Egypt, however they still didn’t want to give us the rooms we have paid for and left us waiting with our baby. He was tired, woken up since 4 am, we had to walk him in the sun in his stroller for his sleep, but the relationship manager had no empathy nor understanding.\n\nMr Emad’s answer was - and I quote - “we are in a cash bussines, we need to receive the money”. I tried to explain their business is based on human relations and experiences, not solely on money, since most people work multiple months for a holiday, but it felt like talking to a wall. We’ve received a lot of other unprofessional answers and explanations, this review would be too long if I would quote them all.\n\nAfter our first day was ruined and multiple phone calls to our Romanian travel agency, the general manager of the hotel gave us our rooms and theoretically an upgrade to a slightly better room.\n\nAnother aspect we’ve been negatively surprised of is the variety and quality of the food from the standard restaurant - under what we have experience in another Rixos hotel.\n\nWhat we have loved here:\n- the vegetation, flowers, trees, were wonderful and very well preserved;\n- Rixy Kids Club, amazing for a 1 year old;\n- The staff from the restaurants and beach cabanas (Ali); also Natalie was very kind and supportive through our check in process and afterwards (restaurant reservations, cabana booking etc.); the man who cleaned our room was super hard working and made a great job every day;\n- The a la carte restaurants were very good (Turkish Lalezar, special thanks to their kind and professional staff; Mangal; Salt; Asian).",
