      "text": "I don’t recommend this hotel! It was the most terrible hotel. Out of 5 stars, I’ll give 2 stars with a stretch. Maybe it was good 40 years ago. It’s so old and dirty that you want to use the antibacterial wipes all the time. The choice of food is poor, often undercooked or overcooked that it is impossible to chew and dry. They often give yesterday's food.After dinner you won't find food at the hotel. \nOf the 4 pools, only 2 were working and they were dirty. One pool is under repair, the sound of a saw from the morning until the evening - the hotel does not report this so as not to lose money. Someone shi..... in heated pool and I didn’t see any special cleaning done in it  The workers at the pool which is closer to the sea are very aggressive and not friendly. The show in the evenings is bad. The snorkeling pier is rusty and not well maintained.",
