      "text": "Chose this hotel for my daughter because water park included. The hotel was extremely disappointing. Public areas were very dated but clean, bedrroms were dreadful, dirty, dusty and bathrooms were mouldy with dirt hanging from celings and mould in the showers. Bedlinen was clean but rooms not clean at all. Food offering in the main reastaurant catered purely for Russian and Ukrainian palates and it was a free for all at mealtimes. Plates were piled high and then put into bags for taking away, if you were not in during the first 15 minutes no dessetrs left and poor choice of everything else. Two poolside bars were open during our stay, one served soft drinks and tea/coffee the other served soft drinks, tea/coffee and occasionally beer. These were the only two bars available at the hotel with little or no choce really. The hotel was situted adjacent to the beach which was very convenient,  there was a beachfront bar but not included in all inclusive deal, nghtly and daily entertainment was provided by a group of animators who worked  hard.  There were two swimming pools, one advertised as heated but quite clearly wasn't. The reason we went as previously explained was for my daughte, but the three slides and pool were out of action as they chose to reline the pool, so all in all a bad choice of hotel. Staff were excellent and very obliging but contrained by the hotels shortcomings.  It is quite clear the hotel is lacking investment, upkeep and maintenance is very poor. Around Sharm hundreds of hotels have closed and are either derelict or partly demolished, hundreds of shops are also closed or derelict. When out and about the area is depressing. Weather was excellent for March. My third visit to Egypt and now my last.",
