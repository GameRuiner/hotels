      "text": "Went in February 2024. Had a really good experience, I was a bit nervous because of the mixed reviews but honestly the place was so beautiful!\nThere’s activities, entertainment, multiple pools and a water park!\nRooms are spacious and clean.\nThe food was of mixed culture\n, probably not the best for picky eaters but my family and I really enjoyed, we had a server called Hassan and he was really nice and even got us a birthday set up for my dads birthday.\nIt’s really good for the price so I recommend.",

      "text": "First of all don't believe reviews with 1 contribution was written by hotel who asked for guests phones these guests couldn't speak English this verified by a staff member.\nThis hotel is 4 star not 5 the pool area is lovely kept clean but very slippy few guests including myself fell needs non slip mats. Liked there is adult only pools which means nothing as kids and parents ignore pool guards twice we have seen kids pulled out as Egyptian parents let kids run amok using guards and everyone as babysitters. There is a smaller pool we use where kids do not get to use. Lots of cabanas very busy but pool chap will find u beds and keep them every day for a small tip. Muhammad smiley man and Alaa deserve a mention their attention 100% and a credit to hotel. Music round pool bumping need ear plugs it is not a nightclub.\nPool bar staff were atrocious as previousl review spoke to manager they were moved next day and can only praise them since. Ice lollies at 2pm free lovely.\nNice touch in room beach bag with beach towels in they can be changed as needed by room attendant.\nBedrooms good size 2 double beds table and 2 chairs plenty of drawers and wardrobes. Rooms  have been newly painted very comfortable beds and clean white linen, bathrooms need updated mastic and couple cracked tiles but also clean. Shower over bath but not too high there is a grab rail to step in water hot, toiletries ,hairdryer and nice white towels changed  every day\nOur attendant room 4107 kept our room spotless sheets changed every 5 days floor mopped.\nSatellite tv BBC and ITV free safe and fridge  bottled water provided every day.\nBalcony table and chairs each block only 2 floors high if mobility problems suggest no higher than block 5 as it goes up to 20 and  has 24 steps to top.\nAnimation team poor no games only aquarobics don't introduce themselves only interested in younger people. Zumba chap gets down syndrome girl to help with class who was brilliant gives her his tshirt which she treasures then asks for it back next day disgusting he did this to look good in front of guests in pool. Entertainment for adults non existent aimed at Egyptian families who keep children up till midnight similar to a kids club at Butlins.\nAlcohol basic no Baileys. Malibu etc.\nDining room food dreadful same every day stews rice fish and bland pasta shepherds pie on menu was mashed potato no sign of any meat also food luke warm. Chips at lunch if your lucky as Egyptians take 5 plates lived on cheese roll lunch every day went out to eat most nights. Breakfast best has most things nice omelettes and fried eggs.cereals, fruit, yoghurt.\nI will agree with previous comments the rudest people I have come across a free for all no queuing just push in not a please or thank you uttered. \n Once a week barbecue at sister hotel which was very nice at beach which has double carriage way to cross but drivers stop to let you across as there is speed bumps. You can get soft drinks only on beach free.\nItalian restaurant forget pizza and food awful most things on menu not available.\nThere is no Tex Mex restaurant but nice to get table at mealtimes as quiter you can bring food in from main restaurant although it serves limited food as well.\nPlease complain they are excellent at sorting things out give them a chance left lovely bowl fruit in room to apologise for bartenders behaviour.\nPharmacy and shop very good not overpriced.\nWaterpark a joke 1 mile uphill to an almost derelict park 2 rides working but not enough water to slide down should be shut down.\nOverall  nice resort  shops and lovely beach hotel  definitely not for UK tourists pick another hotel will be complaining to Easyjet.",
