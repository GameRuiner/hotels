      "text": "Four Points by Sheraton is a very convenient and neat hotel in case you are a little bit familar with İzmir. The rooms are clean and spacious with balcony, and more importantly, all personnel are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. \n\nThe hotel is centrally located near the Bayraklı courthouse area, and is within 10 minutes walking distance to 'Stadyum' metro station. \n\nThe only shortcoming of Four Points Sheraton is its lack of its own parking space. In case you arrive by car, you may have difficulty in finding a parking spot inside the garage of the Mistral residence/shopping center. In that case, the hotel personnel kindly park your car (even though the hotel does not provide any valet service)\n\n",

For English-speaking users, please be aware that there is only ONE staff who was able to communicate in basic English (this is important if you are signing up for anything or require *any* information). We ended up paying *double* of what was agreed. In cash.\nI followed up with an email requesting that they look into the incident but there was no sincere effort to address my concerns and provide appropriate compensation. We were just told that the info they gave was correct and no efforts on their end to share how the case was investigated or a follow up. Highly disappointing for such a reputable brand.",

The service at the hotel was excellent. The front of house team was superb and Melike and her team were welcoming and most helpful. Housekeeping was of high standards as was the restaurant at breakfast. We had a small problem with our balcony door which could not be resolved on our first evening, so we were moved to a new room immediately and the hotel staff followed up with us to ensure that we settled well in our new room. The service at the hotel was excellent.  Thank you to the team for a comfortable stay.",
