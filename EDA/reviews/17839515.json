      "text": "Hotel is situated in the Poblenou area of Barcelona which is a quieter district.  You are a street away from numerous bars, restaurants, shops and cafes.  The beach ‘Bogatell’ is less than 10 minutes walk, through a park area and is a large stretch of sand.  It is clean and has a few beach bars.  There is a metro station 5 minutes away from the hotel and from there you can easily get to all the main tourist attractions that Barcelona has to offer.\n\nThe hotel is clean and modern.  The rooms have a very comfortable bed, plenty of hanging and drawer space and the shower is hot and powerful.  There is also a hairdryer, shampoo and shower gel if you are travelling light.  There is no kettle (we took a travel one) and no fridge but as we spent very little time in the room this wasn’t an issue.  The basement bar was excellent and reasonably priced.  Breakfast was also very good with a huge selection of hot and cold food and drink. \n\nThe pool on the roof looked wonderful however as the weather wasn’t quite warm enough we didn’t try it out but the view from the roof was amazing.  It was a shame the bar on the rooftop wasn’t yet open but am sure in the summer this is a great place to sit, swim and relax.\nWe loved Barcelona and enjoyed our stay at Hotel Voraport.",

      "text": "We stayed here as a couple as part of a package deal. \n\nOn arrival (a €35 taxi ride form airport) we were early (around midday) and just expected to be able to drop our cases and come back to check in, but the reception  got us into a room right away, impressed from the get go. \n\nAll staff very amenable, with lots of different nationalities in the hotel English was the common ground and we never struggled to communicate. \n\nBreakfast absolutely fine, really good continental selection with a small cooked section. Never struggled to get seated even at busier times.\n\nRooms appear recently done. Given Barcelona is currently in a drought you would not know it. Excellent water pressure and great shower with nice soaps etc in room. Beds very comfortable and room very clean with nice views from upper floors. Hardly heard any other rooms or people so must be good soundproofing. \n\nAround a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station where you can connect into the centre really easily. Also about a 10 min walk to the beach which has a really nice stretch nearby. Nice pool area and terrace  on the roof with good views, water not heated but once you're in it's fine.\n\nAll in all a fantastic hotel and we would not hesitate to come back here if we wanted to come back to Barcelona.",
