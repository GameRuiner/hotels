Hospitable staff,great location, good food, and lovely room.\nI won’t be looking for any where else to stay when in Barcelona for a long weekend \nThe shower was the best I have experienced in any of the hotels I have stayed in. The location is excellent for night and day. The  last time I was in Barcelona was 30 years ago, and I now know I hardly seen any of it back then. A smart phone (didn’t exist. Back then) and the location of the hotel changed all that!\nThanks Martin",
