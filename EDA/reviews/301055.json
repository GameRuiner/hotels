      "text": "I was at the hotel for a week. I wasn’t a fan and remain unhappy with the hotel and its staff. The cleaning staff were amazing and kept the room nice. The reception staff were grumpy and unwilling to help when things went wrong during my stay. I would never recommend this hotel and would suggest you avoid it completely. The area of izmir is also very strange, as I’ve been to Istanbul, marmaris and Antalya where people are friendlier and services are better!\n\nSo the hotel:\n* windows open from bottom to top, very dangerous and can easily fall out and die!\n* cockroach in bathroom, they changed my room once but I found more and started going to the toilet downstairs!\n* hotel only gives 1 small 500ml bottle of water for free each day, so you have to go buy your own water locally! I’ve been to a lot of countries where they give you free complimentary water with a larger limit or at times no limit to how much water you want, so this shocked me at the hotel!\n* tv did not work and the staff were not willing to help when I called downstairs.\n* lift is tiny and only for 2 people at a time so expect to wait a while to go upstairs to your room!\n* breakfast is very basic, tasteless, bland and I was unwell/vomited once!\n\nAnyway, that’s my review, and I’ve been as honest as I can. I won’t be returning to the hotel or to izmir, there are scammers everywhere and the taxi drivers are rude and aggressive! I managed to see some sights locally but nothing to sing and dance about.",

      "text": "The room was clean in general; However, the service could be better and they even didn’t offer free tea or coffee in the room, compared to the high prices they take! The breakfast they served was good. The view is good side-view of the sea, even though I hoped to have a sea view. Note that the location is near to the city center and a good destination, if you are after business. If you’re after tourism, pick another location far from the centrum.",

Room was big and comfortable.\nThey had a kettle, tea, coffee, water and an iron in the room.  The mini bar was also well stocked....\nMy bathroom door got jammed while I was inside....could happen anywhere....once the reception got to know they immediately worked on it and sent someone to rectify the problem.\nThe lady at the reception...I don’t know her name...was very helpful with giving me directions on how to get to Çeśme and the airport.",

Easy to drive to the door of hotel.\nRooms: Old furnished but clean and decent rooms with good w-ifi connection. The bathroom amenities are ok but with low quality; there is a kettle for coffee and tea. TV has many national and international channels. I had  a non-smoking roomin the non-smoking flat, however there was a smell of smoke, the bell boy told me it was due to smoking flat at downstairs.I didn't ask for it but they indicated that they have a pillow menu.\n\nFacilities: Indeed this hotel does not offer anything extra to spend your time there. As an asset they have free parking/valet service. Breakfast is not rich in varieties but enough.",
