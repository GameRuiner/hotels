      "text": "Fabulous stay! Small compared to many hotels in Egypt (we’ve stayed at 15 different ones in Sharm and Hurgada) but there’s absolutely nothing lacking at St. Georges. Staff and service: amazing. Safwat in the lobby bar is friendly and attentive. Akram and Saad at the pool bars and Abdl on the beach couldn’t have looked after us better. Korelos, a young waiter in the restaurant will undoubtedly have a successful career, his cheerful smile and effectiveness would brighten anyone’s day. Hotel is very clean and well cared for (if a little dated) and food and AI drinks are good. The entertainment team are friendly and work hard to make everyone’s stay enjoyable. Free shuttle bus to beaches, the Old Market and Naama Bay means that you can get out and about at very little cost. This was truly a great valuable, very enjoyable holiday for my husband and me and my daughter and son-in-law. I would definitely consider visiting again and highly recommend the hotel for couples and families.",

      "text": "We arrived on Saturday 9th March, when we arrived we were greeted by a lovely gentleman Michael :) He promptly showed us to the Restaurant to make sure we were having a warm meal before settling in. We stayed in a Room around the quiet Pool the room provides everything you need, Water replenished daily and the lovely Housekeeper will give you more if you need it, you have Tea/Coffee making fascilities which again is topped up everyday, we did take our own Tea Bags (as you do), we got fresh milk either from the Restaurant at Breakfast or the lovely Pool Bar guy will give you some Milk for the Room. The balcony is spacious, the bathroom spacious...there is a Hairdryer which I did use but wish I had brought my own (my own is quicker and has a longer lead), I thought the Beds were comfy but my Pillow was Rock Hard however...you can ask for a softer Pillow. The quiet Pool area was just lovely, we have never been to this Hotel before but we felt at home almost immediately with the other guests :) the Pool Bar guy, the Towel guy etc...just lovely. Restaurant was great, there will allway's be something that you can eat, we had no problems at all at any mealtime, compliments and a massive shout out to those in the back ground, Chefs/Kitchen assistants you are doing fantastic :) the front of house again a massive shout out your great guy's :) To the Garden/Maintanace teams your hard work is appreciated the grounds are well kept and beautiful :) I know the Drinks aren't the best but this is with most Hotels in Egypt you can get duty free from the Airport...there is also a Duty free shop on arrival :) Just to say the Hotel provides Transport to and from the Coral or Sandy Beach (all inclusive available at these areas), they also provide Transport to destinations such as the Old Town, Naama Bay and Soho Square, just put your name down at Reception to reserve :) There are Taxis available outside the Hotel, make sure you agree the price :) Well we have booked to come back :) Kick back everyone and just enjoy your time, thank you St George Homestay :)",

      "text": "Stayed at this great hotel many times and reasons I keep returning is def the staff,nothing is too much bother for any member of staff.\nOn arrival we treated like family staff remember your name,have your drink ready,check in is so quick,cases taken to room,I messaged Michael few days previous to arrival to ask for extra pillows as I have some medical concerns,got to room and pillows were waiting.\nRooms are getting bit dated but I really just want a clean comfy bed and rooms are cleaned daily so I’m happy.if you need anything topped up in room housekeeping staff are helpful and efficient.\nLobby bar staff are great Safwat,Ehab,Saad,Kemal all looked after us,remembering our drinks,making sure we ok,very friendly.\nActivity pool was busy and kept clean by towel/lifeguards,we were looked after by Walid then Akram they were brilliant,drinks brought to us as soon as he noticed we getting low,both ha great rapport with all guests.\nBeach bar was Magdi,Kerolis 1st week again they helped get me onto sand and lounger,not easy as I’m wheelchair user but boys didn’t complain.\nRestaurant ALL staff so helpful,I got my nightly portion of fries brought to table and drinks at table waiting for our arrival,we had mines and friend Gina birthday celebration meal and staff had table looking lovely and of course all staff sang traditional song to us,really makes your night.always plenty to choose from and I’m a fussy eater but I never struggled with choice,chef very happy to make something on request.\nEntertainment round pool was as always good fun,love how everyone’s competitive side comes out playing game of beanbags lol.\nDef missed Adam,Eslan as sometimes activities or night shows were changed last minute but I still loved it and team try best to get guests involved,hearing what other guests say the issue is tent area it’s mosquito central,seats so uncomfortable and it doesn’t feel cosy,much preferred when entertainment is in lobby bar.\nAliya has such a bubbly personality and I can tell she takes work seriously as there weren’t many kids when we were there but she still tried to engage with them,even just playing chase or having water fight they loved it,she is not just good with kids she also very good persuading guests to join in other activities she def an all rounder,really hope she stays.\nSmall annoyance which was noticed by many guests,the sunbed situation getting more like Benidorm,people putting towels on bed 5.30/6am before towel guys start then don’t use beds or reserve lots of beds and don’t use them all.the wooden beds are clearly lot easier for guests with mobility or health issues but found they were popular with other guests too,I have no issues with this but maybe the blue beds need to be replaced even able bodied guests say they too low and uncomfortable.maybe wooden beds could be kept for guests with health issues,and towel guys have to issue guests with them,also if towels on bed when towel staff start they removed from beds,I did see towels on bed late at night.some sort of rules need to be put in place as I def don’t want to have to get up get into my wheelchair and go get sunbed at 5.30am.anyway it just small gripe lol.\nAll in all I love this little gem,you don’t pay a lot of money to stay but you get a lot for your money in kindness from all the staff.\nI always ask for room 1031 it’s been adapted,has low sink,plenty handrails walk in shower with seat to sit on,bathroom door is sliding door so much easier.\nHope to see you all soon.x",

      "text": "Just home from a great 2 weeks here, and we will return.\nThis hotel is not 5 star, but it is welcoming,friendly, clean and one of the best stays we have ever had. And we have had a lot.\nThe rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds, plenty wardrobe space,a fridge, air con, bathroom with hairdryer and an easy access shower. They are cleaned daily and fresh towels and tea/coffee and drinking water replenished all topped off with some great towel art.\nPool and garden areas are spotless and well kept, the pool guys and barmen make sure you are supplied with pool towels and drinks throughout the day.\nThe restaurant is also immaculate,  and the food on offer at meal times is good and varied. The staff from the management to the cleaners in the restaurant are fabulous and look after your every need. \nThe lounge bar at night is a pleasant place to sit and chill with a G&T or two, and the beer and spirits are drinkable but not very strong. \nThe only downside is night time entertainment, but that didn't affect us as we were happy to sit in the lounge. Saying that the entertainment team were friendly and encouraging. \nIf you need a little bit more, there are complimentary shuttle bus to the beaches and Nama bay and Soho Square is a short taxi ride away.\nWe went here for a relaxing holiday to escape the daily grind  and unwind, and thats exactly what we got.\n\nA massive Thankyou to all the staff at the Xperience St George, you are all stars, and its you who make this hotel great.\n",
