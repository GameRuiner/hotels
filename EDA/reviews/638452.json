      "text": "This is a nice hotel, enough swimming pools and a nice garden which is treated with care. The bedroom was very modern and always nicely cleaned. Don’t know his name but he cleaned room 4239 very nicely and took his time to make something on the bed with flowers! Furthermore, the food was nice but we experienced that the food was beter at noon then at night in terms of choice. But the service we got in the restaurant by Yosry was amazing! Very friendly man who gives you some tips to do when you would want to hear. Also Sayed, the lifeguard at the swimming pool was very nice and friendly. Always ready to help you and greets you with a smile every morning. Last but not least, the 2 young man at the Panorama Bar at night had an amazing service. Very friendly and always a smile on their face! To conclude, we had an amazing stay here! Only thing is that there is a lot of Italian and Russian people, which we actually didn’t mind because they weren’t as loud as we experienced in the past. They don’t see Belgians coming to the hotel but can really recommend this hotel! \n\nBut BE CAREFUL with the reviews on Booking.com. The hotel puts reviews in your name, without you giving consent! This is problematic and just falsifying information. This left a bit of a bitter taste after our nice vacation here, so to the hotel: Stop doing this as you will get nice comments from people because it is a nice place to go too.",

Staff in the restaurant very not friendly.\nSwimming pool with slide close from 12-3 which is  very strange to close the most entertaining place for children at this time of the day . Just the beach had beautiful coral reef and 1 heated pool which we spend most of the time .Hotel is just for Russian tourists which they are behaving disgusting especially on the buffets and nobody from the staff is reacting plus all the entertainment or shows is most in Russian language \nUnfortunately I can’t recommend this hotel and we won’t be back again !",
