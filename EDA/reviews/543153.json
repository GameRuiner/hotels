      "text": "Well located hotel in Las Ramblas that's what I'd call \"different\".\n\nNo room service.  No tea or coffee facilities in the rooms.  Large rooms with no furniture other than the bed and wardrobe - i.e. no desk or table as which to sit with a laptop.....I found that really annoying.\n\nBeds are huge and comfortable.  Bathrooms have large shower spaces, are open plan and have toiletries provided.\n\nThe room I stayed in (from the photographs) appeared to have a lovely little lounge area with a balcony overlooking the street - this is what initially \"sold me\" on staying here.  The reality is completely different - the lovely little lounge room with balcony is a complete separate room across the hall from you and it's not nice - furniture very uncomfortable, a hammock that no one other than a ten year old is going to conquer and just a coffee table.  Not impressed.\n\nBreakfast is just behind the main lobby and more than adequate.  There is a rooftop \"honesty system\" bar from which you can take (please write your name and room number on the paper provided) snacks.  The breakfast area also has a selection of sandwiches and wraps and drinks available for you during the day.\n\nThere is a \"business area\" i.e. a PC with printer available for your use in the lobby.\n\nThe staff make this place - the reception staff are the nicest people and go out of their way, above and beyond the call to help you.\n\nIIt is walking distance (about 3 minutes) to the main Las Ramblas thoroughfare and there is plenty to explore in and around the hotel - it's also only about 10 minutes walk from the Gothic area.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this hotel, it's perhaps not everyone's cup of tea and I really would have liked a desk - but for service and location it's definitely worth it.",

      "text": "If you can manage it - and probably book well ahead - I can‚Äôt imagine you staying anywhere better than Casa Camper Barcelona. We are in the first week of an 8 week European trip (from Australia) and think the hotel has set the bar very high!\n        We arrived after a long day of train travel from Zurich and despite what our tired brains felt, it is less than 10 minutes slow walk from the Rodalies/Metro lines at Pla√ßa Catalunya just down La Rambla and into a typical small calle. The reception staff were all wonderful but special thanks to Carlos who welcomed\nus on our first night in such a calm, friendly manner that we immediately felt at home (assisted by Tomas who kindly showed us around). Carlos was there to farewell us after our week‚Äôs stay - I don‚Äôt remember feeling this sad to leave a hotel! I didn‚Äôt get the name of the young woman who was also super helpful on other evenings but I want to give a special shout out Daniel who served us our brilliant breakfast every morning. He was so helpful and understanding of our lack of Spanish and Catalan, explaining some of the differences between the two. \n        I knew that ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù were provided by the hotel and figured it would be some adequate sandwiches and yoghurt. But no, from the breakfasts (DO try the Spanish omelette and the pancakes and the pastries and‚Ä¶) to the array of snacks, the food here is next level. Delicious baby croissant with Camembert and salmon or mini baguettes with avocado, mushroom and dried tomato and lots of ham options, plus salads, cold pasta and rice dishes; the menu varies from day to day and helped when one of us was too unwell to go out and when we had to go somewhere and weren‚Äôt sure about getting food. \n        The room (we had a King with a balcony, not one with the two areas across a corridor although others said they were also great) and it was lovely. The bed was very comfortable, a free litre bottle of still mineral water was provided every day (in addition to the free bottles con gas downstairs (or cole or whatever you like!). The shower offered a ‚Äúhandset‚Äù or a rain shower head with great water pressure; and I do recommend a balcony if you can - our view was of a tiny calle and people‚Äôs everyday apartments. The room does have no overhead light, it‚Äôs all lamps, so that may be a bit dark for some at night (we had the balcony windows plus two more floor to ceiling windows for daylight).\n        Wherever we wanted to go was within a ten minute walk either to the place or to the metro eg an 8 minute walk through the lovely neighbourhood to the L2 purple line metro that takes you straight to Sagrada Familia - 7 minutes on the Metro! 15 minute stroll to La Palau de la musica Catalana (do go!) and another 15 to Parc de la Ciutadela. Less than 1 minutes to the Opera House (Liceu). \nIf you‚Äôre confused, the front of the hotel is actually obvious once you‚Äôre there and highlighted by red lighting lines, next to the ‚ÄúBar‚Äù (aka gourmet restaurant!)",

Far from the stuffiness of so many hotels, this place oozes with energy and youthfulness. The rooms are spacious and cleverly designed. And little quirks like having a hammock in the room just add to the fun of the place. Breakfast is terrific - lots of choice, nice and fresh. Not a bain marie anywhere to be found. And I love that they offer drinks and snacks you can access during the day. But the best thing is the staff. So friendly and knowledgeable, and they take the time to show you around and find out how they can make your visit to Barcelona truly memorable. Perfect location, great staff and a wonderful energy - I'll definitely be making this my Barcelona base whenever I'm in town.",
