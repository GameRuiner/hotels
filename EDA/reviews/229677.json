      "text": "The hotel is located in the newer part of the city, in the shopping district and easily accessible to the metro and taxis on the street.\n\nThere is a bevy of staff in the small reception area trying to be helpful with the door and luggage. Check in was efficiently handled.  \n\nThe room is well furnished though a bit compact. I had a view of the side street from my window. The highlight was the thoughtful placement of lights, alcoves and charging points. Well designed I must say. \n\nBathroom had a tepid shower - should be improved. And for the extreme compact size of the bathroom, the separating outward opening doors for the western closet and shower and basin areas were a bit problematic. \n\nBreakfast was nice, good spread and choices. Not included in the room price (astronomical during MWc) and they can be more transparent about this as well. But the breakfast is recommended.",

      "text": "We had a two night stay in February 2024, the hotel was easy to find and well located on the main shopping street (directly opposite Gucci). Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable, well light and a good temperature. Pleasant surprise that the smellies in the room were Rituals ðŸ˜Š well stocked toiletries including a razor, toothbrush etc. great rooftop bar that serves food and drink all day - slightly pricer than other bars but great views of the Sagrada Familia and one of Gaudis houses. The only let down was the refreshment tray; cheap and tasteless tea and coffee sachets and no biscuits!",

We wanted something in center of Barcelona that was upscale but without unnecessary luxuries like at a full-on resort. We'd leave our room about 9AM and return about 1030PM. There are excellent restaurants close to the hotel. We tried Taktika Berri and Restaurante Gresca, both were excellent experiences as well. \n\nThe rooftop bar has a very nice view. We didn't use much of the amenities but the hotel room was nicely sized, modern, and the view of the quiet courtyard was nice. The hotel staff was very kind and helpful as well.

      "text": "The lobby and surrounding area is beautiful, and the staff were very helpful.  However, the rooms are badly in need if an upgrade,  Weâ€™ve stayed at this hotel in the past, when it was affiliated with the now, Monument Hotel, and the rooms were much better at that point.\n\nTheyâ€™ve aged a lot, and they are insanely dark.  Barely lit hallways await you, as you find your way to your room.  The carpeting is old, and perhaps why they keep the lights dimmed.  The bathrooms are also in need of an upgrade, and the showers have no shelves at all, so your bath products must go on the floor.  The family room was large, and had steps leading down into the sleeping quarters.  The balcony doors donâ€™t open, but look as if you can get some fresh air.  \n\nItâ€™s a shame, since we used to love this hotel.  Itâ€™s located in a fantastic, and very walkable part of the city.",
