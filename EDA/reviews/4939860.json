The hospitality was amazing, providing an excellent service in everything I needed for my stay. The breakfast was so delicious, well prepared with the best quality and  with a big variety of options, made up by local products! The location was very convenient, located right in the heart of the medieval city in a beautiful and quiet area, but at the same time right by all the busy parts of the city. The hotel’s architecture and aesthetics is amazing, arts and photography, unique furniture and all the equipment to make my stay very comfortable and pleasurable! My stay was unforgettable! Truly recommended and looking forward to returning very soon. Thank you very much Kasseris family and staff for making my stay unforgettable and providing this exceptional hospitality and experience for my stay in Rhodes.",

Everything about this hotel was excellent, including the friendly staff, delicious breakfast buffet, comfortable accommodations, and location in the Old Town. Our suite was “Forms of Light”, which we highly recommend because of its large private terrace with fantastic views (as long as you don’t mind climbing 3 flights of stairs). We also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Nikos, who showed us some of his beautiful photos taken on the island.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we return to the island!",

The hosts, Marios and George, were amazing. A lot of attention to detail, always offered their help. The included breakfast was a beautiful spread too and yummy. The rooms, the decor and overall the staff and the cook (Vaso) were top notch type of people. They will win you over with their charm :)",

It is spacious with the  window overlooking an ancient site.\nThe breakfast served on an elevated terrace overlooking the twon was outstanding and individually prepared each day with slightly different dishes.
