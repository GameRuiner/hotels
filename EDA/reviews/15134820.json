The grounds were immaculately kept and the food was wonderful but what made the stay for us was the staff.\nGeorge at reception was so welcoming and very helpful. Whenever we had a question or request he had the answer immediately.\nAhmed was responsible for our room/turn down service and he always exceeded our expectations. He was so friendly and helpful with any requests we had, and our room was always spotlessly clean.\nOur favorite part of the day was dinner in the gourmet market hall. I do not believe it would be possible to deliver better service. Absolute shout-out to Abanoub. He made every meal there a memory. Always made sure we had everything we needed, from the first day remembered what we preferred to drink and would have it ready before we could even ask. Absolute legend.\nMy husband and I both plan on returning as the entire experience was unforgettable and all the staff really do make you feel as though you are home.",

      "text": "This is by far the most outstanding and wonderful hotel we have stayed in, bar none/ worldwide. (We have travelled widely and stayed in many hotels throughout most of the continents).\nWe have had the pleasure of experiencing staying at the Pure Lifestyle Hotel in Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn and its superior quality is unchanging. We are already planning our fifth visit.\nThe hotel is perfectly located on the Red Sea, with a private Adults only beach, and the adjacent, idyllic Alex Bar and Restaurant exclusively catering for Pure Lifestyle hotel guests serving superb lunches and delicious fine dining in the evening watching the sun set.\n \nThe beach and hotel are separated by stunning grounds, immaculate gardens and a 9 hole golf course, maintained and manicured by an army of gardeners.\nThe hotel frontage is taken up by two beautiful heated pools with entertainment, music and a relaxed poolside dining area, or seating to just relax and enjoy the spectacular views, with a refreshing cocktail.\nThe hotel itself is a tribute to wonderful contemporary taste in interior design and décor. Each luxurious bedroom is immaculate and lacks nothing to ensure that all the needs of its guests are met.\nThe gourmet Market Place restaurant, with an outside terrace for dining takes advantage of the amazing views, and is the perfect place to enjoy exquisite freshly prepared meals either at the beginning or end of the day. Nothing is too much trouble for the excellent staff to ensure that culinary expectations are exceeded. Each hand prepared meal is a delicious work of art.\nA hotel of this quality is so much more than its beautiful location, grounds, boutique design and buildings.\nWhat is equally impressive is the calibre, quality, skill and attention to detail of all of the staff which complements the ambiance of the whole environment.\nThis is due in no small part to the expertise and talent of the General Manager, Mandy, who by her own example has created a first class, guest focussed team. It is particularly impressive that individual members of her staff clearly hold her in the highest regard and have expressed great respect for her in shared unsolicited compliments.\nIt is difficult (and possibly a little unfair) to single out individual members of staff who gave particularly good service. They all gave impeccable care for their guests and were extremely attentive and responsive to even the smallest request.\nThat said In the Gourmet restaurant, the Head Chef, the skilful Sushi maker and Mohamed the artistic Eggs Benedict creator, and another Mohamed, the Fresh Fruit magician together with of course the fantastic table service provided by Mina and Emad all deserve special mention.\nMary in Guest Services was also very attentive and anxious to ensure that every guest was getting maximum enjoyment from their perfect stay.\nSimilarly the team at the Alex Bar and Restaurant went to great lengths to ensure that each dining experience was special. (We have celebrated two birthdays there) Asad and Ahmed went out of their way as usual to ensure that each visit was memorable. Roshdy was tireless and always cheerful to ensure we had cooling drinks on the beach.\nThe service in reception could not be faulted, nor could room service, or the cocktail bar for those excellent cocktails. Megahed, in particular, knew our tastes after day 1 and thereafter appeared with our drinks almost as we were sitting down.\nIn short the whole team again more than exceeded our expectations and made our brief stay so memorable.\nWe came for this latest visit with our dear friends who normally holiday in the Caribbean. They were completely blown away by the hotel facilities and particularly the service which eclipsed anything they had experienced in the Caribbean. They were very impressed indeed.\n \nFinally from arrival and in all the restaurants and facilities as repeater guests we were always greeted with “Welcome back” or “Welcome home” to this gem of a hotel\nWe look forward to many more “ Welcome back” greetings in the years to come. We think of the Pure Lifestyle as our Happy Place and will certainly return.",
