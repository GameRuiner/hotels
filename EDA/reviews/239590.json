      "text": "Stayed at this small hotel for three nights while in Barcelona. It is in a great location near the metro and only a five-minute walk to La Rambla and Catalunya square. I had a single room which was clean but tiny. The bed was comfortable but very short. If you are a tall person, you would have both your head and feet touching the walls. The staff was attentive. The walls in this place are very thin and you could easily hear people talking and doors closing. There was a strange rattle in the building every few minutes which must be caused by the passing trains in the subway which must run under the building. I didn’t spend much time in the hotel other than sleeping and showering. This hotel met my needs and I would stay again",

The area around the hotel had plenty of restaurants and supermarkets with the airport bus less than 5 minutes walk. Would happily recommend this hotel and would definitely come back. ",
