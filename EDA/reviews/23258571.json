There’s a lot of things it need to be improved the housekeeping is always forget to replace towel for the floor , face towel. Replacing tea, teaspoons etc, we have to call the reception almost everyday to ask for it. The service for breakfast is nothing special a whole bunch of young guy’s doesn’t know what they’re doing.the pool is tiny we didn’t use it. The beach is a public areas lots of outsider is been using the beach and hardly find a place to sit. The ocean is quite dirty and stones.if your coming in bodrum for the first I highly recommend yalikabak areas. I wouldn’t stay at this hotel again.",

The rooms are lovely, really well decorated. Lots of food options in and around the hotel. Breakfast was very nice. The only issue is Beach area is strange and not very nice. Dirty water and rocky beach. They have this large green area that could be a lovely pool area. Instead the pool is an after thought, really small and not heated. No good for kids.
