      "text": "Well located a little difficult to find though. A great deal of roadworks outside the entrance made for a dusty bike parking. Internally the hotel is average. Repeated power failures in the room was annoying. A loose and exposed power socket would be dangerous with any young child. Breakfast was also quite ordinary.Staff were friendly despite the language barrier.You always get what you pay for",
