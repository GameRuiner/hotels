      "text": "Have been travelling to Pefkos for quite a few years but always stayed at different accommodation so this was the first time at the Matina and it did not disappoint. Perfect location, short walk from the beach and pubs and restaurants, with a lovely restaurant on site Meltemi and Peoples Bar/Matina Bar and two fab pools with plenty of sun beds. Staff were always friendly around the complex and on the first morning when our toaster did not work a quick call and we received a new one. We felt so relaxed during our 11 nights that we’ve booked again for next year. The apartments some would say need a bit of an update but to be honest we found them fine with everything we needed in the kitchen area and having a table and chairs was good.  The bathroom was fine, the only thing I’d say is the shower is stuck on the wall at an odd angle to use properly and the shower curtains need replacing with maybe a screen but apart from that we had no issues.  The beds were comfy and there was enough clothes space. I would recommend this complex, its basic compared to the odd few but is adequate enough for what you need.",
