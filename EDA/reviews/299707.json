      "text": "Disappointing Stay at Ibis World Trade Center Dubai - Beware of Bedbugs!\nThis review details a terrible experience at the Ibis World Trade Center Dubai in March 2024 from Sunday 17th to Saturday 23rd.\n\nUnacceptable Room Conditions: My stay was marred by the presence of bedbugs. I woke up with several bites on both legs and a hand, resulting in significant swelling and pain. This not only caused physical discomfort but also necessitated a hospital visit to address the issue.\n\nPoor Response from Management: Disappointingly, the hotel's response fell short of my expectations as a full refund of the stay was expected. Instead, they only offered an upgrade to the Novotel World Trade Center for a future stay, a complimentary transfer to the airport and a free buffet dinner. Although that was appreciated, it does little to compensate for the immediate intense pain I experienced, and the health concerns and inconvenience caused.\n\nTo make matters worse, during my upgraded stay at the Novotel, my request for a late check-out by 8 pm was denied. The best they could offer was a 5 pm late check out, as I was told by the reception, was the decision by the Duty Manager and Director of Rooms. Needless to say, this added further frustration to the experience, as my flight was only leaving by 11pm.\n\nPictures Included: For transparency, I have attached pictures taken in the room featuring the bedbugs as well as the swelling caused by the bedbug bites.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Ibis World Trade Center Dubai was a nightmare. I would strongly advise potential guests to consider alternative accommodations.",

While we have fewer to no concerns of the same, we cannot deny that such occurrences are possible, given the nature of catering to business travelers. We uphold high standards of cleanliness in our rooms and take our guests' feedback seriously. Hence, we have ensured thorough room inspections and heightened pest control measures.  \n\nWe express gratitude for your acceptance and appreciation of the service recovery gesture provided. We anticipated that this effort has fostered mutual understanding and agreement between both parties. Although our intentions were sincere, we acknowledge that it may not entirely alleviate the inconvenience you have experienced.\n\nWhile anticipating your return to Novotel and your subsequent stay, our team ensured a comfortable experience and addressed any previous concerns. However, as much as we would like to accommodate every guest's late check-out request, we regret that fulfilling such requests is subject to availability due to our busy operations. Thus, we did not intend for this to cause any frustration. Given the operational limitations, our team tried their best to provide late check-out options until 9 pm.\n\nWe regret that all our efforts were not sufficient to appease you, and we wish you nothing but the best in your current and future endeavors.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDynne Binua – Director of Rooms\n",
