      "text": "We stayed 2 nights in this hotel: it’s very clean, the rooms are large, bedsheets and towels are very clean, sincerely I was nicely surprised. \nThe location is great: 2’ walk from KültürPark and 10’ walk from all nice coffee shops and restaurants in Alsancak, 15’ walk from Kordon. The area is nice, quite and safe. \nThe stuff was of help and willing to support with anything we asked for.\nBreakfast was ok, nothing extraordinary, but enough (the kek was really tasty and fresh).\nFor sure we would stay again in this hotel and we highly recommend it! \n\nEnjoy your holiday!

      "text": "The front desk help are very pleasant and warm. The rooftop terrace breakfast was ok by local standards.\n\nOne thing to note about most public places in Turkey; even though there are smoking laws for restaurants and hotels, most places smell like cigarette smoke.\n\nThis hotel was no exception to that observation. The first room we were given was in very poor condition, with a filthy shower. We asked to move and fortunately they did so. However, we were here due to an historic snow storm in Istanbul which closed down the airport. So being stuck in Izmir was nice. But being that it was cold, we would have appreciated a room with better heat. There was no heat at all in the bathroom.\n\nThe location was very convenient, with markets and plenty of restaurants nearby. Buy when we are traveling for long stretches, we really prefer a little Better accommodations.\n\nThey did have very good wifi, which is important when stuck due to snow delays.",

We had to leave for a flight around 4:15 AM, and they brought plates of food to our room in the morning since we were going to miss breakfast. Of course they gave us chay (Turkish tea) when we checked in. The service was the best part of the hotel.\nIf you are driving, the streets getting there can be narrow, and there are one-way streets as well. Parking is in a gated, gravel lot behind the hotel. Someone who knows their way around and knows how to drive in Turkey should be OK, but driving there can be an issue if you are not used to it.",
