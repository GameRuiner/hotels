The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The terrace view couldn’t be better. Diving into the sea directly from the private shore with a „Pieds dans l‘eau“ experience feels as good as an evening stroll through the nearby old town and parks. Without any party hotels nearby, this is home away from home in a quiet athmosphere in central Antalya. If anything, they could change the music playlist once in a while, but that isn’t worth complaining… If it wasn’t adult only, we’d come more often, but next time the kid is staying with the grandparents, we might be on our way! Thank you so much for a perfect end of season stay!",
