All staff were very polite and welcoming.\nLoads to do on campus and don't really need to leave for anything apart from day trips.\nGreat customer service, we had an issue with people above our apartment dragging chairs all hours of the night, service team apologised and issued us a late check out on our last day and that helped us out a lot as it was a late flight.\nWe will definitely be coming back here and we will also be visiting other hotels in their chain. Thank you for a great customer service and holiday.",

      "text": "Our holiday was for 10 days at the end of the season as a family of 4 with 2 adults, a 17 and 11 year old. We arrived in the evening, dropped our luggage in the room and went for food. There was a small wait for a table but there were 2 queues, one for a table inside and one for outside. The food was great and we always found something we liked although my daughter was a little restricted with an allergy to tomatoes but she still always found something she could eat. We ate at all the restaurants and really enjoyed the pan Asian in particular. Pizza at the beach bar was convenient and we had gyros takeaway from the Greek/American restaurant just inside the grounds on the way back from the beach a few times. Pancakes and frappes were also a daily stop and we'd enjoy a seat in the shade and a family game of cards.\nWe loved the whole feel of the grounds, like a little village with 2 storey buildings, plenty of plants and cats (which my family loved). Our room was lovely and clean although we did get a lot of ants in at one point. My son didn't want to kill them so we put some orange peel where they were coming in and that really made a difference. We loved having 2 rooms so my 17 yr old could have her own space and the view out of the room was lovely even if we only had a glimpse of the sea.\nWe didn't use the pools much as they were salt water and quite cold. We preferred the sea and spent a lot of time snorkeling as there were lots of different fish to spot. We liked to go to the right of the hotel to get our own quiet spot which was probably easier as it was end of the season.\nThere is a lovely bar just down the street from the hotel 'Mosa Beach Bar' which we went to a few times for a change of scenery and it was really friendly and picturesque (ideal for 17 yr old selfies)\nWe rented a car from the hotel for a day and went into Rhodes Town which I would highly recommend. A boat goes from the beach to Lindos but they finish at the end of October so we missed out on doing that trip\nThe only downside for us the very quiet location. We tried to catch a bus to Lindos but as we were just out of season, the buses didn't seem to come as often and we spent quiet a bit of time waiting ( we gave up in the end so didn't get to Lindos). There are a few small shops close to the hotel which bought some gifts in but not much else. I also wish we had booked horse riding but may e next time.\nThe hotel got quieter and quieter each day as it was the end of season which was great for us and the weather was perfect, still really warm but not so hot to stop us doing anything. My son has been asking when we can go back as we all loved it so much",

      "text": "The look of the hotel is lovely. The staff (majority) where lovely in particular Daniel and Dimitris. \nWe arrived on their first day opening after the fires (as informed by reception). There was numerous random power cuts that we was informed was not their fault due to external issues because of the fires. \nThe access to the beach and the amenities was easy. My kids enjoyed the pool and the lego room. \nThe hotel and surrounding areas are clean. There is shops across the road from the hotel. There is shops inside the hotel. \nThe restaurant food was nice. The ribs and tempura prawns in the Pan Asian and the Shrimp taco in the Tex Mex. The sea bass in the Greek restaurant and the brunch also held there in the morning was lovely.\nThe pizza on the beach front was probably the best food I had. \n\nNegatives:\nStairs everywhere (and of course slopes for wheelchair access) but we just found ourselves constantly climbing around the resort. \nThere's not much around and of course it was very quiet but to be expected so close after the fires. \nThe room cleaners where terribly intrusive. Even when you put the \"do not disturb\" sign they continued to enter to ask if we was sure. I found this terribly annoying as I was on holiday and wanted to enjoy a lay in. \nThere was many flies in the main eating hall -However I would imagine there isn't much that can be done about that aside from closing the doors. \nThe pool also had broken tiles at the bottom in some places. \n\nOverall I had a calm and enjoyable experience. I would suggest going in a big group so you can entertain yourselves. ",
