      "text": "Mustafa and Serkan are really the only two positives we can take away from our 6 day stop at this hotel. These two are way way too good for this hotel. Both work tirelessly on reception and can never do enough for you.  The outside and reception area look fine but from there on it gets bad. In fact it gets down right terrible.  The rooms are filthy and the contents such as beds, fridge, wardrobes, shower all belong in a skip. See pics ! Apart from the staff there is no way this even earns a 2 star rating !! Breakfast was mediocre...nothing special but clean and adequate.  The hotel is situated bmore or less central and everything is reachable with a 20-30 min walk or a 5-10 min taxibride.but bevwarned, it is directly opposite a hospital which incurs lots and lots of traffic.  Also, lots of stray cats and dogs walking around.  Again, it's a shame I've had to say these things and the staff deserve such a  better hotel to work with.",

Good toiletries.\nHad a very nice breakfast included in our room rate.\nHad on street parking directly outside.\nBed was good. Towels were soft.\nFridge in the room.\nOnly two criticisms are that there was a little noise from other rooms and the bathroom was not well cleaned and had hair in it.",
