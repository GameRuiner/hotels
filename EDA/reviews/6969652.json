      "text": "First time staying here and I must say with the service and attitude of staff it's unbearable.\nCame all the way here from RAK to celebrate my mom's birthday with the family and I must say. THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR FAMILY TO STAY !!! The way that Eslam expresses his service to us and the rest of the staff is heartbreaking.And with my family as witnessed of the way he deals the issue is not very hospitable and we felt unwelcomed. We have been staying here in UAE for long years but never have we experienced this kind of service in attitude and visitor restricting policy. After continuously trying to explain to him the situation  he wouldn't even listen. All we asked is to give us some consideration in letting my visitor stays for couple of hours since it is a gathering from my family members accross UAE and they won't be staying over. AGAIN HIGHLIGHT ON NOT STAYING EVER, He brought the policy that indicated  additional guest must be charged for spending a night of 200 which we clearly say that they will not stay and they will only visit for couple of 2-3hrs And after all this discussion the rest of the staff are just nonchalant and didn't care about us. From the checked in up to this point it's all disappointing. \nI have nothing more to say but BIG NO. It felt as if having a big family is not allowed is not welcomed. \n\nI didn't care for the upgrade when they failed to do the set up I requested after having it confirmed all I ask them is to let my visitor spend some quality time with us since it's the sole reason I booked. \n\nI would suggest to all the travelers who is having a gathering, celebration or a big family to not stay here because the service and the way they deal things here are not very hospitable. Rooms are nice but it's the service that wants you to come back which they obviously don't have.  \n\nWorst stay ever.",
