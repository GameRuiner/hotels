One for activities and the other adult only, which we used for relaxing.\nWe did a few excursions with mido which were very good and reasonably priced.\nWe had several massages and I would higly recvomend Jasmine.\nAnna was very attentive and was always making sure everything was ok so thankyou Anna.\nThe food was good and the restaurant staff always very helpful with a smile on their face.\nThere was entertainment on the roof nightly which was good, the animation team did a good job too.\nThe reception staff always helpful.\nWe used the hotel taxi service instead of the ones outside as we felt it was safer. Abdo gave an excellent service and nothing was too much trouble.\nOur housekeeper kept our room clean and tidy, leaving various animal shapes with the towels. He made sure we had everything we needed.\nWhat really made our holiday were Mahmoud on the reception bar, Atef on the roof bar and Mustafa on the beach bar and roof bar. They are all so nice and friendly and made sure we had all we needed. \nI got bitten badly by mosquitoes and they gave me ice in bags to relieve the itching.\nWe had good laughs and banter with them and will miss these lads lots.\nWe hope to  come back soon\nThankyou for a lovely stay.",
