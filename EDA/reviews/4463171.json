      "text": "We really enjoyed our 5 night stay. For starters, the location is perfect for the sites we were most interested in visiting, especially the Gaudi buildings. The staff was among the best I've ever experienced. Gianmarco was particularly helpful and friendly, though I guess he moved on right around the end of our visit...too bad for future guests. The bed was excellent. My only nitpicky criticisms: We had a junior suite, but none of the furniture besides the bed was comfortable to sit on. There was nowhere near the sink to hang a hand towel. The light switches were in odd places. We liked the terrace bar, but it seemed to be a little understaffed; it was sometimes hard to get their attention. But overall, we were very pleased and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Barcelona.",

The hotel is in a great location for exploring the city’s many attractions mostly walking distance from the hotel and the rooftop bar is a lovely area for an aperitif with great views. however the breakfast was a real letdown, on the first day all was fine but on the second and third days when the hotel was more full the staff couldn’t cope. They ran out of bread for toast, no pastries, no orange juice, no eggs, no water and when I asked when they were to be refilled I was met with blank looks, I had to go up to reception to complain and to be fair they refunded the breakfast for my entire stay.\nI would stay there again but room only.",
