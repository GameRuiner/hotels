The hotel has a very nice bar with wonderful staff during the evening shift (terrible during the other hours) but unfortunately the bar closes at 11pm so we couldn't just enjoy it at the bar of our hotel after our dinner. The hotel is really very good with a good bed and a good shower, but keep the negatives in mind.",

No one advised us of this on booking or on check in. We spoke with front desk on checkout about this and they accepted their fault and advised us to speak to hotels.com for a refund. We have since done this and they are now claiming everyone was informed and refusing to compensate. \n\nI wouldn't have stayed here if I had known. This level of customer service is despicable and shows total disregard to paying customers in favour of a cheap buck for a party. It's not a nightclub it's a hotel.

      "text": "We had a nice stay until up until New Years Eve where we discovered that the hotel had sold out the entire lobby/bar to a group running a New Year's Eve party with pounding DJ music until 2 AM. The hotel is completely open-concept, so even on the 5th floor it felt like our room had been turned into a club. At first they said the music would go off at 1:00 AM, but it just kept going and going and they refused to turn it off \"because the people at the bar had paid for the party.\" Absolutely no regard for people who had paid to actually sleep in the hotel. I was looking forward to giving this property a good review from our 5 night stay, but the way this was handled left such a bad impression, I won't return. Had we been notified at booking or even check in, I might have had some understanding, but instead we got a middle of the night surprise. The hotel basically tried to profit twice - first off people paying to sleep here and then off people partying here and the people trying to sleep got screwed.",

Our guests’ experience is extremely important to us, and we apologize if we did not meet your expectations. \n\nWe would have appreciated the opportunity to hear more about the positive aspects of your 5-night stay, rather than departing with a lingering sense of dissatisfaction.  People drive us to create unique experiences and we wanted to be part of this world known celebration that is New Year’s Eve. We regret if there was any miscommunication regarding our \"Gala Dinner\" celebration, which was extensively promoted on our hotel webpage.\n\nWe do understand that you experienced some inconveniences during that night, and we, once again, apologize for it. As we tried to communicate upon your departure, and during the conversations we exchanged while at the Hotel, we just wanted to offer the whole New Year’s Eve experience to every guest’ who wanted to share it with us.\n\nPlease rest assured that your insights are invaluable to us, and we are committed to implementing measures that enhance our service for future special events.\n\nDespite what occurred, we would love to welcome you back and hope you regain your trust in Pulitzer Hotels. Please do contact me whenever planning to come back to the city. I will personally help you with all the details and happily welcome you back.\n\nBest Wishes, \n\nJúlia Salvador – Front Office Manager\n",
