They joke all the time, it's nice.7 days a week - a day of different national cuisine. If there are special requests - gluten-free, vegan and the like - no problem. Very attentive chefs: Sherif and Ismail are always ready to suggest the composition of dishes, as well as create an individual dish for you from what is presented in the hall.
