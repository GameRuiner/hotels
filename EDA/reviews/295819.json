The hotel is in an isolated area filled with palm trees, beautiful gardens and an amazing beach front, which also has a wide deck filled w  beach chairs. Service was impeccable—Turkish version of the Four Seasons standard of service.  All staff were friendly, addressed me by my name, and were available whenever they were needed.  Food was simply perfect—even met the chef at dinner time, whom after chatting about Turkish  cuisine,  went to kitchen to create an entree not in the menu.  Gym was decent, great tennis/pickle ball court.  Beach was outstanding. Overall, loved the hotel—for sure a winner and I will visit again and again.  This is my go-to hotel for Bodrum.",
