      "text": "A fantastic understated hidden gem in Barcelona. The service was incredible because of how kind, helpful and chilled the attendants were. The check in and out times (1200) were fantastic and the free daily breakfasts were delicious with fresh fruits, breads and a variety of cooked items.                                                                              \nEven though the room was 'basic'- this photo is quite an old photo, it was perfectly clean and very quiet (even though it is on the main street). Being on the main street made everything I wanted to do perfectly accessible e.g. lanes and lanes of culture right from  the door step, all types of public transport, great food and coffee, Big Red Bus, shopping. I cannot recommend this hotel and the service enough! Many thanks! Kimberley",

The staff was very helpful, the room was comfortable, quiet, clean and is the perfect location for being in the center of sightseeing. You could easily walk for one end of La Rambla to the other. Easy walk to the cruise port even with luggage for a senior single. Close to the subway and bus stops. The single room I book was exactly at pictured, the breakfast was filling with a good variety of items. If I ever get the chance to go back to Barcelona, this is where I want to stay again.

Right on La Rambla, surrounded by street cafe's and restaurants yet priced very reasonably. Reception staff were attentive, friendly and extremely helpful to us in acquiring a taxi outside on our departure.\nBreakfast provided was as substantial as you wanted to make it, no problems finding a table even with the hotel full, and staff on hand re-filling the buffet as necessary. On request we had a quiet room at the rear of the hotel where we heard no street noise whatsoever.\nWould not hesitate to use again.",
