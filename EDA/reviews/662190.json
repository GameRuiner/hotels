(4102), however, you insisted on installing a lock on the door to the terrace. TUI has advised you to take care of them and continue to look after your children, and that your room setting cannot be changed.

      "text": "Just to start with, forget about the date of stay. I’m writing now because I want people to see it just before summer as more people will go to Egypt, as I will be. \n\nCoral Sea was a hotel that really fascinated me. Upon arrival from Birmingham Airport on a late night on mid-July, I felt so underwhelmed by the entrance in comparison to other resorts across the road. It was dark, no pizazz to it. I thought to myself, “Is this going to be bad?” Simply put, no. Absolutely not. Do not worry about the outside and security guarding the hotel, the heart and soul of Coral Sea was where it was really at. I will be going over 8 things: Cleanliness of the hotel, the rooms, the service, the entertainment, the food, the location of Sharm el Sheikh and the value and will give an overall rating at the end. \n\nCleanliness:\n\nIn terms of how clean the hotel was, it was clean most of the time. You can’t fault the hotel for being dirty because when it was dirty, it was due to someone dropping a plate of food on the floor and the cleaners are coming to pick it up. Trust me, they were rapid at the cleaning. Plates were picked up quickly, tables were wiped so that people could find a table in one of the many restaurants Coral Sea has to offer. \n\n10/10\n\nRooms:\n\nThe rooms were okay. Our room was quite old-fashioned but in a good sort of way, not run down or anything. The rooms were clean, nothing was a mess in my opinion. Rooms were always nice and clean with some amazing towel art on the bed and the mini bar was always refilled (unless it hadn’t been used the night before) every day whilst we were at the pool or restaurant. \n\n9/10\n\nService:\n\nThe service was interesting. Never on a holiday have I ever came across having to tip the waiters but it is understandable considering Egypt’s financial problems at the moment. It was good though, drinks were made quickly and delivered to your sun bed. One waiter I would like to highlight was Ahmed, who was a waiter at the pool bar and entertainment bar. He got to know us and we got to know him. He was very nice and we voluntarily tipped him at the end of our holiday. \n\n9/10\n\nEntertainment:\n\nEntertainment was unfortunately disappointing. If you are the kind of person/people to have a party nightly or have some fun, Coral Sea isn’t the kind of resort for entertainment. I understand that a lot of Egyptian resorts have slightly underwhelming entertainment from what I’ve heard anyways, so I can’t really say Coral Sea’s a needle in a haystack. Compared to countries like Turkey, which I think have the best entertainment, Coral Sea felt flat and empty. It was also repetitive because you had a singer or dancer every night and you wouldn’t have much variety. Sometimes it was okay but not the best that’s for sure. The TV in the room had your classic channels, like a lot of countries, the only English channels you would get are BBC World so we were stuck with a Polish kids channel. The internet was a problem, you had to pay for the internet sadly and it’s not like it worked. Most of the time, you were stuck with internet problems and having to log in again. My advice: pay for data roaming.\n\n4/10\n\nFood:\n\nAs the Germans would say, it was edible. Nothing special but the a la cartes were delicious, especially the Italian, that was spectacular! The restaurants had a lot of themed nights which was good and there were a lot of restaurants to choose from rather than the typical main restaurant. \n\n8/10\n\nLocation (Sharm el Sheikh):\n\nI know this is out of Coral Sea’s control so I won’t count this towards the rating. This is just to let you guys know about the airport and outside of Coral Sea. The beach and Red Sea were good, there would be a beach party occasionally which was good and a fine change of scenery. When you left the hotel, you had to tell the security guards your name and room number so they can let you back in the hotel, understandable. I was irritated by the sheer amount of tourism cars that wanted you to go to and go to explore Sharm el Sheikh, they would just honk their horns to get your attention and you would have to say no multiple times before they drove off. The airport was good bar when you landed, it felt like the population had died out because you were in a massive room waiting for your luggage with barely anyone there with you. The security were harsh to be honest, shouting at us and being strict. Considering Sharm el Sheikh wants to be a tourist attraction, that’s a bad start! The departures area was decent, there’s a Burger King and Duty Free, there’s more but those are the ones to highlight. It’s a huge airport by the way.\n\nValue:\n\nIt was expensive but the water park and quality paid off, it was overpriced but it wasn’t a bargain to say the least.\n\n9/10.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis is the chart I’m using:\n\n1/5 = 0-2/10\n2/5 = 3-4/10\n3/5 = 5-6/10\n4/5 = 7-9/10\n5/5 = 10/10\n\nIt’s a giveaway as to what I’m rating Coral Sea because you saw the rating before reading the review but my average rating was 8.2/10 so in the higher end of a 4/5. Hope this gives you a good idea of the hotel! :)",

Hany (waiter) and Abdo (animation team) were incredible, attentive and genuinely the loveliest people.\nOn the last day , just as we left the hotel, the management stopped our coach from departing claiming that the TV remote was not in our room and that we would need to pay $80 to replace it. We did not use the TV in the room once and did not take it. when refusing to pay $80 for a remote we hadn’t taken they refused to let our coach go and claimed loudly that we owed the hotel money bringing security and multiple members of management. We felt shocked and humiliated. In the end we payed the money as we were going to miss our flight but i would not recommend the hotel to anyone for this reason. it was a shocking end to a lovely holiday. the management team are poor, we saw angry team meetings going on within main areas of the hotel and the completely random accusation of the TV remote seemed like a plan to get money out of us moments before leaving the hotel. Unfortunately we will not be returning .",

      "text": "Just returned from this wonderful holiday.\n\nI really can't think of anything negative to say about this resort. Had 10 wonderful days here. The waiters, bar staff at the pool and the evenings were brilliant. The beach staff couldn't be more helpful. The cleaner was lovely and cleaned the room very well. The animation team were lovely especially  Oliwia and Darcy. \n\nI wish I could name all the staff but there were too many to remember.  They were all so lovely helpful and very friendly.  \n\nIf there was a negative I would say they should have a bit more food choice for non meat eaters but that is a minor. \n\nI will definitely return oneday.",
