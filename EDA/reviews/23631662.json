      "text": "When I was looking for a hotel online I searched for days and days to find what would be the best place to stay , based on value and location and quality of the hotel , I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect from this hotel as the price seemed very cheap for the two weeks stay . \nI arrived at the hotel and first impressions were good , the room was big it was clean and it was new ! , you couldnâ€™t fault anything , it even had modern light switch controls by the touch of a button . The walls were spotless looked as if nobody had ever stayed in my room .  Everything you could possibly need was in the room , including wardrobes and fridge and ironing board and coffee making facilities. \nThe location was a nice residential area , quiet and accessible by taxi to anywhere you need to be in 20 mins or so for a small fee . Personally the location was good for me as it felt like living in your own apartment rather than a hotel . \nThe hotel offers a selection of restaurants and bars and has a very pleasant swimming pool area, as well as other facilities too , they organised a lot of excursions for me from the concierge that were all very good value and enjoyable experiences. \nFor the entire duration of my stay the room was silent , and no noise from other guests , Iâ€™ve stayed in places which are 10 times the price that donâ€™t have this level of comfort . \nThey even offer a free day pass to a beach club on the palm , and a free bus to get there ! . \nCompletely free ! \nThe value here is unbelievable, back in England you wouldnâ€™t get anything at this price of around 65 pound per night , itâ€™s so affordable and luxury too ! , my advice to anyone is to stay at this hotel and go enjoy Dubai . If you want a beach there is plenty in Dubai to go to . \nThis could be one of the best hotels in Dubai at the moment and itâ€™s highly rated on here too . \nAmazing Iâ€™d definitely be returning to this amazing place .",
