      "text": "I scheduled a couple's massage through the spa receptionist named  Grace on WhatsApp, but there was a misunderstanding regarding therapist gender preferences. She personally asked for my number and asked me to approach her whenever I wanted to visit. Despite assuming we would be paired with two female therapists, that I mentioned on the form, I found myself uncomfortable in a room with a male therapist. When I requested a change, the therapist seemed unsure and suggested a partition, which didn't alleviate my discomfort. This lack of briefing and the resulting discomfort during the session left me feeling unsettled. \n\nI haven't received any follow-up regarding my complaint, and I'm frustrated. The thought of being nearly unclothed in a room with a male therapist during Ramadan was upsetting. If I had known beforehand, I would have requested a transfer to a different room. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.",
