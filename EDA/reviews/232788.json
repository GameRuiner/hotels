The hotel was charming with a sense of stepping back in time, but also with modern amenities. Very comfortable beds!\nThe staff and management provided noteworthy service  in that when we had unexpected glitches in our air travel plans , they were most accommodating of our needs. Highly recommend this hotel.",

      "text": "What a great location! Even after six nights, I kept finding new and interesting things that were just a block or two away from this hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  This is an older hotel, in the mid range of pricing but the motif of early 20th century modernism fits in perfectly with the neighborhood and Barcelona. and you get very good value for your money because they have excellent staff and a nice bathroom shower set up and if you choose a courtyard room, you’ll have quiet nights. Someone staffed the front desk 24 hours, which truly helped especially when I had to check out at 2:30 in the morning to get an early flight. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. But definitely stay there again.",
