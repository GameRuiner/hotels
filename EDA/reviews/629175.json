      "text": "I hate to do poor reviews and held off reviewing it for a while - in the hopes the hotel would communicate about our awful experience, but they didn’t.\n\nI enjoy staying at unique and quirky accommodation and the XVA ticked the boxes with the price too. However we were utterly shocked at the condition of our room: We stayed as 2 adults and a young child for just one night. \n\nIt wasn’t until I felt tickling on my skin whilst in bed, turned the light on and realised the bed and entire room, was teeming with ants. I’m not talking about one or two.. hundreds. With broken sleep and swatting them throughout the night, probably ate a few too.. we woke up early and swiftly left our ant infested room. \n\nThe bathroom was riddled except they were all dead, including the towels to dry with after a shower. Shudder. \n\nWe escalated our concerns immediately to management that declined any sort of reimbursement except “maybe a free stay?”. Tempting I’m sure, but no thanks. We tried to email to discuss further however our emails were never replied to.\n\nSuch a shame as could be great but pest control needed asap. Poor service because of this and I wouldn’t recommend.",

      "text": "A quirky yet comfortable small hotel in the old quarter. Our room was very clean and serviced daily. The staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nWe arrived very early in the morning well before the official check in time but it wasn't a problem and they let us into our room. The only minus was that it was the hot season (40oC plus during the day / late 30s at night) and the air con was off. We turned it on immediately and left it on the whole time were there but it took a good 24 hours before the room was comfortably cooled.\n\nNevertheless we liked the hotel and would stay again. It's in a handy location about 20-25 minutes from the international airport (expect to pay around 30-50 AED for a taxi depending on the traffic - August 2023). The nearest metro station is around 10 minutes walk away and the abra (water taxi across Dubai Creek) was about 5 min walk.\n\nXVA Art Hotel is a bit tricky to find and your taxi will not be able to drop you at the front door. If you are dropped at the Arabian Teahouse, then walk up the lane to the left of it, turn right at the security guard booth, and you will see the entrance to XVA Art Hotel  by the sculpture on the right of the big courtyard.\n",

Great location on pedestrian street in the heart of old Dubai-Bur Dubai./Al Fajidi area.Walking distance to all the old town sights, the fort, the creek, the souks and Arabian restaurants.\n\nArabian antiques, romantic courtyards, mixed with an eclectic mix of artwork, it's funky and elegant at the same time. Rooms are comfy, and everything spotlessly clean and surprisingly quiet.Very friendly and welcoming staff.\n\nThe restaurant is excellent too... try the paratha omelet!\nIt's hard to find the first time around, especially if arriving at night but the night manager met us where the taxi dropped us off.\n\nWe normally stay in more high end hotels but so glad we stayed here and would happily do so again.",
