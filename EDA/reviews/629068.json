The receptionist quite frankly needs a different job (eg not working with people) as his solution to this problem was to try and move half of us girls to a different room, leaving just one with this dodgy man.

The elevator was broken, so I had to carry my 20+ kg/50 lbs of luggage up 5 flights of stairs and had to walk up 5 flights every time I went out to get back to my room. Further, my key card stopped working twice, so I had climb up and down a total of 10 flights of stairs to get it fixed. The bathrooms are very dirty and smelly. Further, there was a very creepy old man in the room hitting on guests and jerking off.... I do not recommend this hostel.",
