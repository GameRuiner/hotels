      "text": "My review is for the Chef House Restaurant. I invited a friend with his family along with mine to dine in during Ramadan Iftar. The quality of the food was poor and specifically the meat.  the refill on the buffet was not adequate. They brought in the lamb and was finished from the first round. By the time we went to try it, it was all gone and no back filling. One smart solution was to bring in part of the cooked lamb incremental to avoid such situation as an example.  I was really embarrassed in front of my guest. They included coffee in the deal but not tea. Cup of tea was 22 AED meaning that we had to pay additional 88 AED just to drink Tea after meal. The experience was trouble, and we definitely will not go back there again. This is really shameful considering that the restaurant is a reflection of the Radison Blu reputation.",
