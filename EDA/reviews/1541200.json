      "text": "I had high expectations due to the great reviews. An adult only resort was nice. No kids! \n\nWe arrived around midnight as our flight departed slightly late from the UK. Distance from airport to the resort was only 30-40 minutes.\n\nPrivate transfer is a highly recommended but there is a cost.\n\nOn arrival we had a warm welcome.\n\nWe had chosen the bungalow with side sea view and outdoor whirlpool. Our room was 1801 and it wasn’t the side sea view as expected and described. \n\nThere were ants in the bedroom. We found hair in the bedding. This was resolved and rectified.\n\nThe resort is beautiful.\n\nMy only issue was the food. Breakfast was awful. Not everyone eats cheese or meat. The lack of variety and options was disappointing. I love my food and I wasn’t happy. The food only caters for European people. \n\nStaff were really nice and accommodating.\n\nIt was our wedding anniversary and I’m grateful for the nice gestures by the hotel.",
