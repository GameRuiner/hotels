They went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and had what we needed to enjoy our stay.   We utilized the gym which was clean and had modern equipment.  We also enjoyed a relaxing massage with skilled therapists and followed that with a 45 min private use of the water area and sauna. It was a great way to end our visit .",

Everyone from Roxy as the concierge, Constanta at the front desk, to the amazing staff at Pantry (Oliver, Robin, Leonard, Carmilla (?)), Shayne, Snow and Poncharu of the breakfast crew made my stay an amazing experience. If I got your names wrong, I apologise- I have a crappy memory. The hotel is wonderfully equipped with a well stocked coffee bar and offers a good range of bathroom products. For those who care, the range of available free TV channels stretches across national and about 30 international channels. For those who want to keep moving during their stay, pack your running shoes. The beach walk is perfect for both promenade and running. I hope soon to return on my next trip.",
