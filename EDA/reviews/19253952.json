      "text": "During my stay, I encountered a range of experiences that shaped my overall impression of the hotel. From the importance of greetings at the main entrance, which made guests feel valued and important, to the helpfulness of individuals like Hussain in providing clear instructions in the elevator, there were moments of positive interactions. However, there were also areas that could be improved upon. For instance, Jamila's lack of communication about the readiness of my room despite prior booking arrangements was noticeable, and the issues in the room, such as hair on the toilet floor and a broken curtain stick, detracted from the comfort. The delay in receiving a dental kit from Housekeeping, despite two reminder calls, highlighted the need for more efficient service. Additionally, while Ian's welcoming return made our stay pleasant, the disruption caused by housekeeping knocking on our door twice, despite the Do Not Disturb sign, was frustrating. The breakfast experience had its ups and downs, with a friendly greeting at the buffet but also unclean tables and issues with the apple juice glasses and coffee station. These experiences collectively emphasize the importance of consistent customer service, attention to detail in maintenance and cleanliness, and clear communication throughout the guest's stay to ensure a positive and memorable experience.",

We're truly sorry to hear about your experience with the cleanliness of the bed sheets and pillows during your stay. This is certainly not the standard we aim to uphold, and we apologize for any discomfort this may have caused you. Rest assured, we take your comments seriously and will address this matter with our cleaning staff to ensure they receive the necessary training to improve their performance. On a positive note, we're glad you found our hotel's location convenient, being close to the metro route and adjacent to Ibn Battuta Mall. We appreciate your valuable input and hope to have the opportunity to exceed your expectations on your next visit.\nKind regards,\nMaya Ombuh\nDuty Manager",
