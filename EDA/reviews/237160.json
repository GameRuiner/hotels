      "text": "The bedroom very nice, hotel in overall pretty good. \nLocation super. \nThe reason I rate a poor experience is not because the hotel itself, but due the poor postservice experience. \nI left my Iphone charger plugged in the room 413, and I realised a couple of hours after I left the hotel. I phoned them and someone in the reception told they would check it so I could send someone to pick it up later. \nHowever when my friend got there to pick it up, disaster...they didn't know anything, got him the wrong cable. \nI had to phone again, very bad attention from the frontdeskkk and I give it by lost. Today, my friend went back to the hotel and now they say no one has found it. So tough!\nI hope they can improve the procedures of lost&found items with the housekeeping area so it won't happen again with nobody else.",

In the am spoke to a different person who was great explaining that AC in std room is shut off for season but the upgraded rooms AC stuff worked ( a bit bizarre to me) they did change us to an upgraded room. But really to turn off in some rooms and not others plus the attitude of the night person was bad.  Would I stay again probably not!",
