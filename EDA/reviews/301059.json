      "text": "I liked this hotel , the staff are kind and friendly , and our rooms were very clean.\nWhat I will say though, is that Alsancak is a very interesting area and personal taste definitely decides whether you will like it or not. There are many little shops and places to eat around the hotel - but as for the night time experience of Alsancak, I wouldn't say it is the best place - as around the neighbourhood there weren't many people around and I have been to more inviting areas of Izmir like Karşıyaka or Bostanlı. This is just a note about the location though ; as for the hotel, it was nice, very efficiently run and a good place to come for a few days.",

We had a beautiful room on the 4th floor facing the gardens.  We had everything we could want in the room, tea and coffee machine, air con, a beautiful walk in shower.  Everything was clean and authentically presented and the beds were so comfortable we actually didn't want to leave, or wanted to take the matresses home with us.\n\nThe staff were amazing they were very helpful with calling for taxis, giving advice on things to do and places to visit, always happy and friendly to talk too.",

We stayed for 7 days there but there was not even a small change the breakfast menu. The internet connection was terrible. Every minute we needed to insert username and password to get connected and again after a very short while it got disconnected again and again. The staff was bot friendly at all. The air conditioner system was really awful . We could not sleep even for one not due to weather was too hot. All in all , it was really a bad experience staying in this hotel.",

      "text": "We stayed at this hotel in August 2019 for 6 nights. The hotel has many benefits: It was great in location, Access to shopping malls - numerous restaurants and the sea was great. The housekeeper (5th floor) was very kind and active, she cleaned the rooms daily. Everyone was kind in reception but Mr Barış(supervisor) was really kind  and gave us some great directions and recommendations so that on a Sunday when he was on holiday the lady in reception could not guide us appropriately and we got into trouble for the aquarium. The check-in was done quickly and we got to the room at 8.5 am. \nBut the disadvantages of the hotel: The internet in the room was very bad and interrupted every minute and we had to reconnect, while the internet was better in the restaurant and lobby. The room that tour booked for us was double standard and had the usual view (not what we had seen on the internet as garden view). The size of the room was perfect for two people, not three and it was too tight to accommodate the extra bed for us. \n \n",
