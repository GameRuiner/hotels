      "text": "Went to Spain with a tour group and the first two nights were spent at this hotel and i'm so  glad we stayed here! We checked in on March 10th, the check in process was very fast. They already had our keys out with our names on them. The room was comfortable and the bed was wonderful. Since we were with a tour group i don't know what we were charged per night. We did not eat in the restaurant on the property but the breakfast next morning was the best!!!!!! They had just about everything you could want. Like a lot or most European hotels (compared to American hotels) you could not turn the air conditioner down low. Maybe it was the time of year, I don't know. we opened our window and the room was quite cool. We slept fine, no complaints. There were always one or two taxis out front to take you where you needed to go. Taxi fares were fairly reasonable which was good. you are within walking distance to the marina. It was very quiet at night. All of the employees were friendly and helpful. One in particular, Paula helped us out but again ALL were great. I would stay here again!",

      "text": "First impression was we had arrived at a building site adjoining the hotel however we got off to a great start, arrived at the hotel about 1pm but very impressed the room was ready. Staying in a Junior Suite was impressed at the size and amenities and how quiet it was. I presume the Air Con was in winter mode but with the fan on was ok. Usual 2ish English channels (News) available on the tv and surprised they were not connected to the internet WiFi (which was excellent throughout the hotel). \nHad full access from 8am -10pm to the free Privilege room with a tv & bigger mini bar than the room, 3 x wines, Cava & selection of snacks. To be honest, this saved a fortune on drinks at the bar during the stay. (Had a draught Estrella late one night as the wife enjoyed the 2 free cocktails we got during the stay but it was that flat it was untrue).\n\nThe Spa.. used the free access a couple of times & was well impressed with it, only looks a pool on the pictures but there was a lot more in there & 5* cleanliness & quality.\n\nThe free breakfast was plentiful and a huge choice, always greeted friendly by the Manageress Sabine I think her name was & a credit to the Hotel Staff.\n\nIt is in a quieter area and whilst well located to get around, not much else around it without going down to the marina area. The open bus tour stop is about a 5 min walk, the Metro about 10.\n\nWith going for a 4 night Anniversary break, it was nice to get a bottle of Brut delivered to the room and we decided to eat in the hotel most of the time as the bar food was nice and reasonably priced.\n\nNow the downsides to justify my rating:\n\nRoom:\n\n1. Shower had no power to it all & probably the worse I have ever experienced.\n2. Mini Bar - Supposed to be restocked daily and I should not have to keep asking reception.\n\nMain Resteraunt:\n\nDecided to eat in there on our Anniversary.. there were huge conferences on most days and 100’s of people in attendance. We were shown to a table of 4 & the table was split into 2 for some reason as to be honest was very quiet? The table we were left with was very wobbly so moved to the other half.. 30 MINUTES LATER.. no one had been near to ask us for even a drinks order so walked out. Went upto the bar and ordered food but it was that noisey from the open plan design Daniel missed my order despite he saying he repeated it back which he did not…\nReported the issues to reception and raised a complaint requesting the General Manager contact me the day after to discuss. About 25 mins later after the wife had eaten her food, my missing item appeared but with our anniversary meal ruined I refused it, sent it back & took the bill to reception refusing to pay it at that time and for discussion the day after. \nNeedless to say.. no contact from the Hotel Management at all.. As a H10 member I will not chase a response and they could learn a lot from the Hilton or IHG Group on Customer Service..\n\nPrivilege Room:\n\nAs open to all guests with access, sometimes it got busy & drinks / snacks went quickly or were not available when we went in & bearing in mind the area is not monitored, we saw guests letting other people in there… \nNow.. trying to raise this to get restocked.. Reception- speak to the Bar.. \nThis was controlled by Fode.. one of the most ignorant and dismissive person I have ever encountered in a 4/5* Hotel. We will restock it when we can.. we are very busy… Having read the room there was no one at the bar, the place was quiet except for downstairs “conference” duties… I do need at this point to say Blanca was a star & another credit to your hotel. Daniel was a waste of time so stopped talking to him…. Poor Blanca did the best she could…\n\nSummary:\n\nWould we go back to a H10 Hotel?.. not if there was a Hilton, Raddison, IHG or a Marriott anywhere near… not a chance..",

      "text": "Since it was a city hotel, I expected the standard quality that H10 provides, but it exceeded my expectations.\nMaybe from the outside, the hotel looks shabby, but don't be fooled. Ideally located hotel, close to the beach but also to the Sagrada Familia approx. 800-1000m. in a quiet location.\n I really expected noise from the previous reviews, but nothing was heard and we had the window open all night. \nFirst of all, I appreciate the communication with the reservation department with Mr. Aleix Pendered whether by phone or email 10/10.\nRECEPTION - pleasant without chaos, even though we were a medium-sized group and guests were coming and going at the same time. During our stay, there was a Marathon as well as FCB matches.10/10\n LOBBY BAR – the staff who always came to tell us that the bar is closing and that it will be the last order always with smile. 10/10 \nRESTAURANT - we  had only breakfast, the standard provided by H10, maybe if the hotel is full, 1 extra person could be added to the service. \nROOMS - always clean, spacious, good pillows, relatively new furniture, room equipment exceeded that of H10 rooms - safe, minibar, iron + board \n- towels, automatically changed for new ones every day - 10/10\n Interiors - really nice, modern, photos correspond to reality, corridors clean, new elevators+carpets /compare with H10 MADRID./ 10/10\nSTAFF - whether night security, reception, service 10/10\nSpa - was always full, must be ordered in advance.\nThe hotel also provides electric bicycles, bicycles, scooters. \n\n2 SMALL NEGATIVES: The AC  works only at certain times of the year and the rooms can be a bit overheated... \n- It is not possible to \"buy breakfast for the room number + bar\" and pay for it at Checkout... even though I argued with them with my H10Club card. So always have cash/card with you. \n\nOVERALL RATING:  Out of 6 hotels in Barcelona where I stayed, I put it on 1st place. So if they are not full I will definitely come back here.\n\n10/10",
