      "text": "When I have long hours of layover in Dubai Airport, I always choose to stay here in Sleep 'n fly.  I have previously tried the FlexiSuite, Igloo Pod (near Gate A i think), and the Lounge Lite.  However, for this day I only had less than 5 hours of layover.  I was not feeling comfortable about the clothes I was wearing. So I chose to only have a quick shower and change my clothes.  They do have that option where you can have a shower with shampoo, body wash, and body lotion.  The shower was great it comes with hot and cold water. They also have hair blower, towels and a changing area.  Although, I slipped upon entering the shower room the floor was slippery.  I fell upon my hip.  I was okay that day but I felt the pain on the following days.  Anyway, I told the staff that they need to put anti-slip mat or tape at the shower area.  It will prevent slipping incident.  In the future, I will still go here and have a shower given that they provide anti-slip mat :)  I still like this place that's why I'm giving it a 5-star.  They have accommodating staffs, clean area, and it comes with free drinks (coffee, chocolates, soda).",

In-pod USB device charging. I slept for four hours and worked for two in my pod during my six hour stay, but I could have chosen to relax or work in the well-designed common lounge area.\n\nWashrooms are separate, as are showers. \n\nBonus: great coffee maker, plus teas, water and soft drinks are on tap and inclusive.\n\nSuper staff.\n\nMade all the difference to my transit experience and I did not feel I was being ripped off.",

The aircon is preset and felt much warmer than what was displayed. I not only found the space uncomfortable but stuffy and felt like the pod wasn't cleaned or sanitised properly prior to the next set of guests arriving. The staff weren't  friendly either and not welcoming. Wasn't a good experience and instead rather used the opportunity to sit in the business lounge. For the rest of time while in transit.
