      "text": "The hotel was very average. The rooms were very tired but generally clean. The bathroom was shocking and would be rated as 1 star. The shower was reflective of what you would find in shared hostel shower. The curtain was heavily stained. \nThe all inclusive food was edible and very basic. I would not say you looked forward to meal times. The drinks were a challenge and never tasted the same even when staying to the same cocktail. Had to do this as many times there were no ingredients available, so a lot of the drinks were just not being served. To ask for a mojito and to be told we have no mint or limes so we have put oranges in was crazy. The most shocking part of the hotel was the sunbeds fiasco. Most of the beds were taken at 5.00am. Some guests told us they have joined a group that take it in turns running out at 5.00am. It is not a holiday if you are having to be at the pool at 5.00am to reserve a bed. The hotel needs to set a rule that no towels before 8.00am and the only think that reserves a bed is a body. Also not allowing one person to reserve 11 beds. We watched some beds that were reserved having guests turn up in the afternoon. \nThe internet only works in the restaurant or reception area. Even then after a couple of minutes you have to sign back in. Shocking service. \nOn a positive note the staff around the pool are very friendly. Karim interacted with everyone and lightened your time there. The pool bar guy Ahmed was friendly but the other bar staff at reception were very miserable and at one point when they explained they were not doing a particular cocktail just walked off and started to do other tasks rather than offering another alternative. We have been to Egypt before in Hurghada and received a totally opposite experience. This hotel needs to learn from other hotels. It would not take much investment to sort out their problems and improve the customer experience. The restaurant  and hotel manager were very friendly and went out of their way to talk to you. The over inflated trip advisor reviews did not help and actually heightened your expectations to then find yourself feeling let down. To base the hotel ratings on the likeable and hard working small number of staff did not give a true reflection of the hotel as a whole. The gardens surrounding the hotel amenities were well maintained and pretty. Sorry this is not a brilliant review for the hotel but is is 100% accurate and hopefully will not leave you feeling disappointed with your choice.",
