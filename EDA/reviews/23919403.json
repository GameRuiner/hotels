      "text": "Just came back from a truly wonderful holiday at Coral Sea. \n\nThe beach is lovely and snorkeling is amazing from the jetty. You were able to spot little crabs in the rock pools when the tide went out too. If you walk further along the beach you can also walk directly into the sea with fewer rocks. \n\nFor the size of the hotel the pool areas never felt busy but it was tricky to get a sunbed sometimes. The splash park is freezing and was too deep for our 2y old but there was another kids pool attached to the main pool which was ideal. The kids club brought toys everyday to play with which was great. We found the pool areas to be very slippy and saw a few people slip over! \n\nThe staff can‚Äôt do enough for you at this hotel. They are all so accommodating and polite and absolutely brilliant with kids!  Even without tipping they are great. \n\nThe kids club and entertainment team do a great job with the kids and our little girl loved blue tots. I wouldn‚Äôt leave her at a kids club yet but I would be confident in leaving her at this one. \n\nWe ate mainly at the buffet restaurant and the Italian which was nice but hard to book! \n\nThere is a little swap box in the TUI guide room which sometimes has pool toys and floats in. \n\nI was worried about coming to Egypt but felt so safe at all times and the airport coming home was fine.",

      "text": "We have never really been a family who do beach holidays but we desperately needed a ‚Äúfly and flop‚Äù holiday at a super location and a first class hotel and this is exactly what we got! \n\nThis holiday was without doubt one of our best holidays ever and much of this was down to the brilliant staff. \n\nSuperb beach location with outstanding snorkelling and diving facilities which my husband and daughter loved.  The beach never got crowded and the waiters looked after us exceptionally. \n\nThe hotel was just simply amazing. Staff work incredibly hard and were always so kind and polite, going the extra mile without it being overbearing. Immaculate gardens, clean and tidy with so much space to move around without feeling busy. \n\nOur room was fine. A little dark but to be honest nothing really wrong with it. Always cleaned to a high level with towels and toiletries provided whenever needed.\n\nFood was great and always fresh. We ate mainly at The Restaurant where ALL the staff were incredible but a very special thank you to our waiters Khalid, Mohammed and Ibrahim (in the Adult section) who were some of the nicest people we have met. Outstanding manners and attention to detail making our stay memorable for the right reasons.  Thank you Khalid, Mohammed and Ibrahim - your kindness will never be forgotten. Also a special thank you to the lovely chef who made my omelettes every morning and what a special touch when he prepared my omelette on our last day before I even gave my order!  What more could I ask for? üòä\n\nNever being a family who return to the same destination, let alone hotel, I am confident in saying we will be returning and I hope it will be this summer although we know it will be super hot!!  We can‚Äôt think of anywhere else we would want to be! \n\nSpecial hotel with heart warming memories. Thank you all üíó",

For the 10 days we were at the resort we were able to dine out doors every day and our table and service for every single meal was just perfect.

      "text": "We visited for the third time over Easter and had an enjoyable time. \nBeing a popular time, the hotel was full, however, the hotel managed the load well. We have children so are somewhat restricted, however, if you can visit outside of school holidays I would strongly recommend it. \nWe had a pool view room with a hot tub on the terrace, rooms are becoming a little dated, however, are kept clean and tidy. \nWe ate in the buffet once, which was fine. Book a la carte restaurants, (Italian, Turkish & American) 2 days in advance via the pod at reception. Plan well as they get very busy and fully booked well in advance. \nTo avoid the rushes, we booked the Stonegrill and Gokan, both chargeable but excellent. Spent circa ¬£100 for 4 of us in each but well worth it. \nAlso, check Ivo Beach, again chargeable, 90 US Dollars per couple for the day, however, you get a personal service on a private beach with breakfast and lunch. Hardly anybody uses it and we booked for 2 days, first class. \nPools are fine with plenty of sun beds, however, 95% were occupied with towels by 9am. Adult only pool was quiet with a few people enjoying far too much alcohol by the looks of it! \nGym was good, however, I preferred to run along the coast, nice 2 mile path each way which you can loop a few times. \nAll in all, great place to stay and we will book again for wnxt year no doubt. \n",
