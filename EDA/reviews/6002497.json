When you open the drawer or wardrobe, you can smell the last century there. Even though I asked for non-smoking apartment, everything was smelling terrible after cigarette smoke- curtains, sofa, furniture.. actually, the whole hotel smells and they are trying to cover it with some strong perfume, from which you get sick after a while. The equipment is cheap, old and rusty, you don’t want to put food into the fridge or cooking utensils. Bathroom is disgusting with damaged and moldy bathtub, where you don’t want to step barefoot. But the most disgusting was finding some cockroaches…",

Instead he sarcastically said we should cancer right away It was supposed to be a happy day for me because it was my 40th birthday but he ruined our mood and he said immediately to cancel us without giving us another option. he keeps on smiling and sarcastically answered. you can check the cctv for proof.

      "text": "we booked  1 night for our guest,  under my partner's name. We informed the reception before the check-in. But Unfortunately, the receptionist who checked our guest in forgot to scan her passport before giving the key.\nIn the morning when I passed by the reception to request a late checkout, they couldn't find our guest's name, and they kept telling s a different guest.  It took time for him to give the key, and kept saying she is not the one staying in the room.!\n\nI explained to him over the phone that clearly it was their receptionist's fault as he didn't scan the passport. He speculated and concluded right away that my partner gave his id or passport that's why his name was\n the one who checked in the system. Totally  lies   why  did  he  say that  when  he  knew that  nobody  scanned the passport   in DTCM  ( passport/ id  scanner)\n\nThis front office manager as what he introduced himself but feels like not. Abhey didn't act as A manager instead of hearing and understanding his guest he argued with us. what kind of manager can't handle a situation like this?  Even though he knew there was an issue he stood and tried to prove he was right. Imagine letting somebody /check in without taking and scanning the passport/id.\n\nAbhey is the worst in customer service. He claimed he is a Manager but doesn't know what is the procedure or how to check in.",
