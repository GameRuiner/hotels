      "text": "The rooms at the higher floors (we were on the 26th) are very spacious and quiet, fully meet expectations of 5 star luxury resort hotel. there were renovations ongoing in neighboring rooms which affected air at the floor area. 25th floor was all fine. \nService was excellent and personnel were generally very friendly and helpful. The waiter Asila from Ginger Moon was fantastic, always making sure we had a special experience at this place. Prajwol and Amal from Ginger moon were also very good. \nFood at buffet places (Mina Kitchen and Latest Recipe) was good. We rated fish taverna as the best among the in house restaurants. \nBeach experience was affected by nearby construction that created noise but overall was very good. Beach infrastructure is shared between three hotels W, Le Meridien and Westin. Lots of things to do and enjoy. \nLocation is top between marina and palm jumeira. \nWe enjoyed our time at W on our family vacation.",
