      "text": "My family and I spent a delightful ten days at your esteemed establishment, enjoying the pool and beach amenities immensely. The Palmery, your all-day dining restaurant, particularly impressed us with its diverse and delectable breakfast offerings.\n\nHowever, I regret to inform you that our experience was marred by a significant delay in the check-in process upon our arrival. This delay caused inconvenience and discomfort after a long journey, impacting our initial impression of the hotel.\n\nDespite this setback, I must commend the exceptional service we received from the staff in pool area,especially one outstanding individual named Lasith. Lasith went above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction throughout our stay. His attentiveness, hospitality, and personalized service were truly remarkable, and he deserves commendation for his dedication to guest satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore, I must highlight the excellent quality of the service provided at the beach area too.even its too busy and lack of staff although every member of the team contributed to making our experience enjoyable and memorable.\n\nWhile our overall stay was pleasant, I believe it is important to address the issue of the delayed check-in as well as reserving the sun lounges has to be stop to prevent similar occurrences in the future and uphold the high standards of service that Jumeirah Al Naseem is known for.\n\nThank you for you will be back on October..",

      "text": "As a family of 4, we have stayed at Al Naseem several times, however, this time around has been disappointing.  The main annoyance has been the circus around the pool and sunloungers.  We paid a premium to stay at this hotel and as such i would expect to be able to use the facilities as and when we require.  However, the hotel allows guests from the other Jumeriah properties which are significantly cheaper to use the hotel facilities.  The impact is that every morning by 6am guests from the other hotels reserve sunloungers by the pool, for guests actually staying at Al Naseem, in our 10 day stay we have never been able to sit by the pool.  WAGs descend on the hotel and have the ability to have a significant section of the pool area to themselves with dedicated service - even though they are not staying here!  Service in the restaurants in not to the standard as we have seen before.\nI think the price point of Al Naseem means that there are far superior hotels where you  can use the facilities that you are actually paying for.  \n\nI would like to think the hotel will address this as many of the guests that we spoke to had the same comments as us.  For us, think its time to try somewhere else",

The half board allowance should be deducted from the final bill rather than some restaurants charging a supplement as well. this often exceeded the amount we spent.",
