      "text": "We have visit Rhodes for years now. This time it was the best holiday what we ever had. Thanks to this hotel! We have changed our hotels many times throug the years, because nothing really feel right for us. Until last year we made best decision of our life and book Acandia for our couple week holiday.\n\nThe hotel have very nice lobby, but that first impression continues into to the rooms as well. Rooms are fresh and the use of wood brings them coziness. Pillows are comfortable and bed is good quality, so you can rest easy. Air conditioning is the best we have come across in Rhodes. Cleaning was always top notch!\n\nBreakfast was SUPERB! Lots of choice and never runs out. \n\nStaff was really nice. I loved that they were not overly top friendly, which is not our cup of tea. But they were very helpful if you needed help. \n\nThere are so much good things say to this hotel, but easy to say - We will definitely come back. Thanks to make our beloved Rhodes even better for us!",
