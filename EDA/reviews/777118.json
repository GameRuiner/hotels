      "text": "What a venue! Here are the list of pros and cons I found \n\nPros: \nStaff helpful and friendly, nice friendly lifeguard at the pool too. \nRooms were very impressive, we found it to be incredibly good value for money. \nSuper impressive Smart TV - it was huge. \nThe lobby area is very clean and modern (in fact the whole hotel apartment is exceptionally clean and modern - the housekeeping staff are very efficient and good here) \nIt is right near to a supermarket and even closer to a metro, great to get around. \nI can recommend a restaurant for people walking distance - Swiss Butter, only a 6 min walk from the apartments - it was nice to have restaurants a close walk to the apartment. \n\nCons: \n\nNoise of street is audible, if you are a light sleeper you may want to choose a quieter hotel as the noise of outside could keep some people up, we didn’t find it too bad though. \nBalcony was small with no tables and chairs, maybe it is the 2 bedroom apartments which have this (we had a one bedroom)  but was enough for what we needed.\nI think it would be good for them to invest in better irons - ours was a bit of a pain to use. \n\nThat is all! Overrall I think it would be hard to find a modern spacious apartment at this price that is so convenient to see all of Dubai - but we did manage it and here served that purpose nicely! Thanks guys! \n",
