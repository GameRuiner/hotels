      "text": "If you like boutique hotels, then this is one of the gems. Its an old palace that has been renovated into an amazing hotel with a beautiful garden and such an authentic design of the building. The rooms are spacious, very comfortable and well equipped. The staff is very friendly and welcoming also.\n\nThe main problem faced during the stay is the restaurant, its very nice and well lit glass house but the chief isn’t that special. The main courses can be undercooked and seemed microwaved. Yet around the hotel there are several restaurants and bars so that wasn’t a big problem.\n\nOverall i really enjoyed my stay and would come again for sure.",

The original building was built around 1840's and it has been renovated by real experts. The only problem I had was the limited number of choices in breakfast. They can easily offer some Izmir masterpieces like cesme tangerine jam or boyoz (Izmir pastry). But this shortcomings do not distort this incredible experience. ",
