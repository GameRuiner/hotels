      "text": "We ( polish guests ) LIKED the wonderful atmosphere of the hotel, beautiful architecture, gardens, alleys with rows of palm trees and flowers, and the interesting layout of the hotel grounds. BEAUTIFUL hotel buildings. The hotel staff is great.\nThe guests are cultured people (most of them are Italians), the cuisine is tasty and the restaurant is nice.\nUnfortunately, the (quiet) part of the beach has little space for sun loungers, and many of the beach loungers are old. The beach bar is closed, probably for a long time, :-(\nThe large area around the main pools is unused for people who want to sunbathe and use the pools - it is occupied all day long with a music station and bar tables.\nAttention ! :-(((\nThe hotel has built two new buildings right next to the main entrance, which are an architectural nightmare, they are far from the sea, there is also a not serious swimming pool and a funny, not serious bar.\nGetting a room in these new buildings is a bummer, it has nothing to do with the \"Tamra Beach hotel vibe\".",
