      "text": "So many things I enjoyed about this hotel - staff was excellent, bed comfortable, location was perfect. What sets it apart is the small galley kitchen, with a fold out table and chairs, where we enjoyed having our breakfast and a take out dinner when we needed a break from running around. We stayed in a deluxe room on the 4th floor overlooking George Orwell square. With the windows closed, noise was never an issue. In the evenings we opened the windows, and had a glass of wine on our sofa and enjoyed the lively feeling of the square. My only issue was very little counter space in the bathroom. I used a shelf in the kitchen and it was handy enough for my many items. I really loved it here and would definitely stay again.",

      "text": "This hotel is in a great location in the Barri Gotic. The hotel staff are friendly and available 24/7. There is no restaurant on site, so breakfast is delivered to your room (which we didn't do and decided to eat at local coffee shops/cafes). There is a rooftop with a pool, but it was cloudy and/or rainy the entire time we were there so I can't comment on it. We stayed on the 5th floor in the Jewel suite - very nice 2 bedroom, 2 bath room; this could work for 2 couples, as there is a main door for the suite and then 2 separate hotel doors for each bedroom/bath. Note though that the second bedroom is 2 twin sized sofa beds. Also, the main bedroom only has a queen bed that is very firm. There is a lot of noise outside (the main bedroom is off the street and the twin bedroom off the square with restaurants; however, the sliding doors are pretty soundproof and the AC works great! The terraces were lovely for each room. We enjoyed them even though the hot tubs for each could not be used due to the drought. Both bathrooms have hand-held shower nozzle and rainfall showers. Bath products are provided, but note that there is no separate hair conditioner (only a shampoo with conditioner), so bring your own if you have curly/frizzy hair like me!",
