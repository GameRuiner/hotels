So much to choose from! \n\nThe staff work so hard! Especially the fun makers! The activities they put on throughout your stay, thereâ€™s something for everyone! Pilates, darts, aerobics in the pool, morning gym! Highly recommend joining in when you can! \n\nBrilliant array of drinks to choose from, again something for everyone whether you drink alcohol or not. \n\nPool is incredibly clean, pool bar well stocked with food for an afternoon lunch and servers rolling around the pool on roller skates is the icing on the cake! \n\nThank you all so much for this amazing stay!

Although the season hadnâ€™t fully started & the shows hadnâ€™t fully begun outside, most of the animation team done an amazing job and made our evenings very enjoyable and entertaining. Special mention to Mali for being so friendly and welcoming. \nThere was a lot of construction work going on in and around the hotel as they said itâ€™s â€™pre seasonâ€™ - something which we were not aware about. We still had an amazing time, the staff were very attentive, the facilities that were running were great & the food was delicious. I would definitely come back during the summer season.",
