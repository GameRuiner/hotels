The hotel offers a very nice ambiance - arabique features mixed with a modern contemporary style.\n\nWe were up-graded to a Suite room - which was purely amazing and very large in size. Living area, seperate sleeping room, a big bath room and a huge terrace facing the swimming pool. For all girls - you have a massive wardrobe here for all your precious clothes!\n\nAll hotel staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.\n\nWe enjoyed a very good breakfast with many delicious items served as a buffet with arabic and international hot and cold dishes. You can also order your choice of eggs plus healthy food items as chia pudding or Acai bowl to your table.\n\nThe hotel has a common swimming pool, but the best feature is the huge beach pool that stretches over a large area. Sunbeds are placed on a sandy area, so you really got that beach feel, although it is a city property. A beach/pool bar and restaurant is also there.\n\nAs the area around is still under development you only have a few facilities as shops or restaurants in a walking distance. However Festival City Mall is just a short drive away as well as the rest of the city.",
