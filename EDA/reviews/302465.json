      "text": "Updated hotel review: I've been meaning to share my thoughts on this hotel since my last visit. Our family has been regular guests at this hotel for several years, often bringing along extended family members such as grandparents and cousins. The hotel itself and its amenities are fantastic, and we always felt secure during our stays. However, I have noticed that it has become more crowded in recent years.\n\nUnfortunately, I must address a decline in the level of service and customer treatment. Firstly, when we requested a special arrangement for a specific date, something that had been accommodated in the past, this was overlooked during our last two visits. This, however, is not the main reason for my dissatisfaction. \n\nSecondly, when our flight was delayed, resulting in an extra night's stay, our experience was less than satisfactory. Despite notifying the hotel in advance due to the flight delay, we were informed that our room was not available for the extension. Instead, we were provided with a small alternative room for the daytime. We clarified that since we had a half-board arrangement, it would remain the same for the extension, to which we were initially told 'yes'. Consequently, we enjoyed our day, had some meals (paying for some, parts on the half-board). \n\nUpon check-out, the manager insisted that we pay for an additional dinner under the half-board plan, despite our prior confirmation. His demeanor was unpleasant, which understandably upset my husband. This added stress to an already challenging situation with the flight delay. The issue here is not the charge, it is a tone and we told otherwise initially (and overall booking arrangement that were were their for nearly 2 weeks)\n\nSadly, we haven't returned to this hotel for almost two years now. Whenever I think about Dubai, the memory of this poor treatment dampens my enthusiasm to book a stay. It's disheartening that a simple dinner charge could outweigh the significant amount we spent on accommodations and other services at the hotel. It's a shame that customer service standards have declined. Customers deserve better treatment.",
