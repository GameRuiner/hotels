The check in person was not welcoming was actually kind of robotic. They did not advise that the room was a smoking room. It smelled horrible but we were so exhausted we didn't ask to be moved. After being in the room for about 2 hours, I had to call the front desk because it was so hot. My husband and I were sweating! They sent the concierge, he came in and \"explained\" how to change the temperature (instead of just doing it). I did what he said and it didn't work. Needless to say we couldn't sleep that night. ",
