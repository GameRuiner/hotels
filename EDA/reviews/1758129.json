      "text": "We are currently staying at Delphin Beach Grand and it is our second visit, so in theory we knew what to expect. \n\nUnfortunately, I slipped on one of the hotelâ€™s very wet floors (no sign) a few hours after arriving, which has meant I canâ€™t swim or do any of the activities. \n\nTo make matters worse, when I went to the doctorâ€™s to get the wounds cleaned, a member of staff was there with another guest, who had also rather unsurprisingly slipped and hurt themselves. Rather than check if I was ok, this person told me I should not be wearing flip flops as they are â€˜dangerousâ€™. This is in a hotel with 90% of guests wearing them and besides I am well into my 40s and not slipped before from wearing them.\n\nThe hotel is very overcrowded, the food is average, rather bland and pretty much the same at every meal. \n\nWe have a large loft room, which is great, but unfortunately itâ€™s overlooking a swamp and rubbish dump.\n\nOn the plus side, a lot of the staff members are lovely and my kids love  the water slides. If, however, you want a real 5 star and a hotel that cares, look elsewhere.",

To add to the amazing slides and swimming pools, this year theyâ€™ve revamped the beach area into chill out zone, with playgrounds for the kids and two new restaurants.\nRooms are spacious, food is great, staff so accommodating and friendly, spa center is reasonably priced.\nGuest relations staff walk around the sun lounger every day asking guests if they have everything they need to have an amazing stay. We had Natalie to look after us, very friendly and helpful ðŸ’•\nWill be checking out soon, but will return again next year. Such an amazing place!",

      "text": "I have been to two other 5 star resorts in Antalya therefore had high expectations of Delphin.\n\nThe only positive I can give is the waterpark, the rest is pushing a 3 star.\n\nThe evening entertainment is shockingly poor. The cocktails are tasteless and rarely provided with branded spirits.\n\nThe main restaurant is huge and like a cattle market, too busy. Never any cutlery on the tables and service is very slow. Doesnâ€™t seem to be enough staff. The food is ALWAYS cold, it seems like the same food is served Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner.\n\nA la carts are a nightmare to book, have to up before 8am to try get a spot and the food isnâ€™t worth the hassle, again cold, very slow service in the Turkish & Mexican and most of the food doesnâ€™t seem to be cooked fresh, look to be pre made and then re heated. \n\nThere are no daytime restaurants in which you can sit down and order from a menu, you just help yourself to the same Buffet or street food everyday, again cold or undercooked.\n\nMany staff barely speak English therefore it was very difficult to communicate with them. \n\nThe hotel lights were turned off for 4 days during our stay with no explanation to why.\n\nOur view was looking onto what can only be described as a dumping ground to be woken up 4am daily by dogs barking.\n\nI have returned home what seems to be with food poisoning, which doesnâ€™t surprise me. \n\nWhen youâ€™re paying a small fortune, there shouldnâ€™t be so many negatives!",
