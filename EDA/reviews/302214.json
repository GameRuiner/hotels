      "text": "Wonderful holiday resort for families. \nGreat location for beach and marine life fans. Definitely try snorkeling. They also offer all sort of water activities onsite, including diving (PADI), island trips, aqua aeropics, etc.\nAll the food in the restaurants is fresh and delicious locally outsourced, too.\nStaff is friendly, helpful and dedicated people who go above and beyond to provide seemless service. Special shout out to Osama from Le Cafe, Waled from Exotic, Atef from The Waves, Mahmoud and Nour from the Front Office team. \nIf you are looking for a polished glam luxury, that's not the place for you. But if you are in search of an easy and relaxed vacation place, with kind people, genuine smiles and fun music, Royal Monte-Carlo resort is definitely for you.",

The chefs and waiters were very friendly and polite, the desserts looked amazing but were kind of stale and looked fake and very tasteless.\nThere are a al carte restaurant we tried the Chinese which was ok.\nThe others especially the Indian was given such a bad reviews by some the other dinners we did not try it.",

The room we picked was spacious, and they had decorated it to help us celebrate an anniversary.  Although a little dated in design, it was satisfactory for what we needed.\n\nFood choices were plenty, although we had to speak to the staff as we are vegetarian.  Osama and Ayman at the main restaurant could not do enough for us, and we had no complaints.  We even got to speak to the chefs who again made sure we had good food to eat.\n\nAt the Waves Bar near the pool, we had excellent service from Atef and his chef.  We were never left wanting for snacks and drinks.  \n\nThe staff felt like friends, and we always felt very welcome.  \n\nI always find that if you are respectful, it will be returned.  \n\nWe would love to come back in the future and make more memories here.",
