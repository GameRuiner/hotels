      "text": "Stayed for 2 nights and was upgraded which was a nice touch. The suite was large and well appointed but I didn't sleep well. There was no headboard on the bed and I found this really uncomfortable. We were the only ones staying the first night, with another room occupied on the second night.  I felt at times, like an inconvenience. My suitcase was too heavy, I split coffee on the tablecloth, didn't decide quick enough what I wanted for breakfast. Maybe just a different sense of humour but it made me on edge. Other people seem to have had a different experience so horses for courses I guess",

      "text": "We stayed for 8 nights in the Pasha Suite which was a great choice. It was the last week in October and the weather was perfect- even upo to 30 degrees one day and no need for anything with sleeves the whole time. This was the last week of the season and almost everything was still open. I have bullet pointed our comments (but they have vanished), and particularly where we found previous reviews to have commented on a negative, have included our experiences.\n\nPositives\n\nExtremely accommodating hosts (Elena and Duncan) with just the right amount of contact. When you needed them, they went above and beyond. Two highlights were: receiving a bottle of rose on arrival as it was my 60th birthday celebration, but by far the most amazing was that as we were not due to fly until 10.30pm, Elena let us delay check out until late evening, and continue to use the room until then! This meant we had a truly delightful last day, unencumbered by luggage, and were able to shower and change before we left.\nPlenty of privacy\nBeautiful touches like the painted ceiling in the lounge area, gorgeous stone work and some lovely carved wood outside.\nGreat for access to all the amenities and attractions as long as you’re able to walk- bring flat sandals with strong soles as you’ll feel the cobbles though anything thin (not flat cobbles, real lumpy ones!) \nFresh still and sparkling bottled water placed in room every day was very welcome\nVery comfortable super king sized bed\nNo noise from above the Pasha Suite\nGorgeous peaceful and shady courtyard with the constant sound of cascading water and some beautiful flowering trees and plants (sound of water also meant if other guests were in the courtyard, you could not hear their conversations)\nBreakfast outside very relaxing\nLoungers outside in shade and sun to read on, and lots of books (mostly in English) from novels to more highbrow material and guide books in the library (no need to bring holiday reading)\nWonderful steam room with a handheld shower and toiletries within too. The marble is so cool -even just to lie on it is refreshing\nSmall bright reading lamp was provided (in the wardrobe)\nLots of hangers and wardrobe space \nGiant full length mirror \nAir con x 2 - one in bedroom and one in lounge\nLots of beautiful stray cats all around the town, but none in the hotel\nRhodes Old Town is a great place to buy leather handbags and jewellery\nLovely boat trips to Lindos and Symi \nA marvellous and extremely picturesque, historical old town with dozens of lovely restaurants , shops and bars \n\nMinuses (we had to dig deep) \n\nNo fridge in the Pasha suite\nA shower cap would have been useful\nA bit tricky to make a hot drink as you needed a tray or a bigger space / you can ask for milk but can’t store it in the room\nTV did not have any channels- but there was Netflix if you had your own password (we didn’t). Prime was available without own login.\nLighting very dim in rooms giving slightly gloomy atmosphere \n",

My partner's birthday was celebrated with a delicious complimentary bottle of rose and two bottles of local beer.   Stunning hotel, very reminiscent of a top Marrakesh riad and similarly difficult to locate but well worth the effort and what a garden!    The atmosphere is magnificent, the hotel is immaculately clean.  The position is perfect very peaceful.   Could not recommend it more.    We have travelled extensively and it joins our list of best ever places to stay, possibly right at the top.",
