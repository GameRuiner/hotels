      "text": "An amazing all inclusive experience! The room was comfortable and enough for what was needed (only let down was the view from the balcony was a wall but as we weren’t staying in the room all day we weren’t too fussed).\nThe food was great with so many options and I was never left hungry! The bar was good with lots of cocktail options ! 3 pools with plenty of space , a fun games room and all staff were helpful and friendly ! Definitely worth the money for the experience! We recommend hiring a car to explore the island. We did this online before we went but the hotel also offered this service.\nGreat location with a 10/15 minute walk from the medieval city !",

Facilities are wonderful, from restaurants to bars to pools to gym… unbelievable value for money on an all-inclusive stay. I could imagine neither faulting nor improving any aspect ! But great as it is, the staff here are even BETTER. So helpful and friendly, way beyond the call of duty. Every single individual has been great, really lovely: elegant, charming as well as top-notch professional staff throughout the hotel. A particular shout-out must go to Franzeska and Kattholiki at Reception !\nThis place is so brilliant we tried to book immediately for next year, only to learn it is due for a refurbishment ! I honestly cannot imagine what needs refurbishing here ! But we will certainly be checking in order to return following completion of the refurb because we want to come back and want to know how they improved it ! The mind boggles.",

Mini bars in rooms restocked every other day.\nLarge tidy rooms with lots of space.\n\nThese guys could not do enough for our dietary requirements!\nAs soon as we arrived a meeting with the chefs was arranged. There were several eating places within the hotel and so we were able to eat at these also.\nEvery breakfast lunch and dinner the lovely restaurant team (Popi and all the Nikos’ 🙏) would go and get a chef who would then advise what we could eat and then would prepare it from the kitchen to avoid cross contamination.\nBoth myself and daughter are extremely sensitive coeliacs-am happy to report we had no gluttening issues at all!! And we ate ALOT!!!\n\nSo if you’re looking for an amazing hotel, with wonderful staff who will literally do everything in their power to ensure you have a great holiday then this is definitely the place to check out!! 🙂",
