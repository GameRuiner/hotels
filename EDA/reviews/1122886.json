      "text": "Otel Antik Han is in central Izmir about a 15 minute walk from Konak Pier and 5 minutes from the ruins of the ancient agora of Smyrna. The narrow cobbled street, small shops and hotels gives a feeling of old town charm or run down neighbourhood depending how you look at it. There are cheap eateries and shops neighbouring Otel Antik Han.\nFree parking is offered but, on requiring before my stay,  I was told to come to the hotel to be given instructions how to reach the car park, which meant parking first which is not easy in central traffic crowded Izmir. The free use car park is 50 metres from Otel Antik Han next to their \"sister hotel\",  . I found it easier to park in the inexpensive secure multi story car park 50 meters away in the other direction next to the agora. Following the signs to the agora brings you to this car park.\nOtel Antik Han is a small traditional hotel which overall looks a bit jaded. Darkness inside comes from the Ottoman era of construction, but finishes have seen better days. The inner courtyard where breakfast can be eaten is an unexpected delight for central Izmir.\nThe receptionist was helpful and we communicated easily in English. There was a pleasant greeting each time I entered or left. Reception is manned 24 hours.\nThe room was clean and bed comfortable. There was an unfortunate small of smoke, despite the no smoking signs. Water was provided, but no kettle. There were charging points in the room, some near the bed. Air conditioning unit provided adequate heat for a cold winter night. The modernised ensuite shoer room came with towels and toiletries. The shower provided plenty of hot water. My small single room overlooked the courtyard and there was no street noise.\nThere are indoor and outside courtyard tables for breakfast. Typical Turkish breakfast with eggs, preserves, cheese, cold meats, cheese etc. Tea and coffee was on the buffet table, but juice was only available on request. Breakfast was adequate rather than anything special.\nOverall Otel Antik Han was good value for money within walking distance of the seafront and many central tourist sights.",

      "text": "Getting there: I came via bus, I was able to catch the 302 from the main bus station, it took about 30 minutes and I was able to tap on with my bank card. There are metro stations walking distance. It is very easy to find and close to main roads. \n\nLocation: This hotel is in Central Izmir, there is a Migros Jet (supermarket) about 5 minutes away and a multitude of take away places. The promenade along the sea front is around 10 minutes walk away. As a vegan I found I needed to walk up to the more touristy area for food, this took about 25 minutes.  As noted in other reviews this hotel is in an area surrounded by Bazaars.\n\nFacilities: The Wi-Fi is excellent, the air conditioning worked well, as did the television.  The breakfast was a combination of meats, egg, salad, olives, breads and pastries, there was a good selection. Drinks wise the options were tea, coffee and water. Each room has a fridge. Guests are supplied with water in their room but can also access this downstairs. \n\nThe room: I had a room that overlooked the courtyard, it was lovely and quiet. The furnishings were a little weathered, however everything worked and was clean. \n\nThe staff: The people working at the hotel were friendly and helpful, they were quick to offer drinks in the afternoon and made a point to welcome me every time I came into the hotel. I do not speak Turkish, however I am confident had have I needed support we would have managed with translation apps.",

      "text": "Based on the recommendation of \"Lonely Planet\", we (a family of three) decided to stay at Antikhan Hotel for an extended weekend. Unfortunately, the experience was rather disappointing and we decided to leave the hotel after only one night instead of the three nights foreseen. The hotel is in a rather run-down neighborhood in the bazaar area. It is thus pretty far from the sea; walking took us about half an hour. The hotel is equally run-down, somewhat shabby with small, depressing rooms. Our room was dirty (a strong layer of dust on the floor) and, facing the street, rather loud. Breakfast was ok but arriving 1 1/2 hrs prior to its end, the buffet already looked rather empty. Asking for a juice we were told this was not included in the price. Cups and glasses were dirty. The place simply looks old and dark, nothing of the charm one would expect when reading it once belonged to Atatuerk's father. Service was ok, but none of the staff present spoke any English (there was only a young, friendly and helpful  staff member at the reception who was fluent in German). To sum it up: for a backpacker place, it is too expensive, for a mid-range, three-star hotel, everything one would expect is missing.",

Not quite the quaint former home of the much revered Mustafa Kemal Ataturk that i was expecting.   And it was similarly seedy on entering the hotel and proceeding to our rather shabby room.   I might have given the hotel the three star if the pricing were on par with what is being offered. But 40 euros?  No way.  We checked out the next day and got a fine hotel several blocks away and closer to the Basmane train station.  Basically the quality of he hotel was back packer.  But not the price.",
