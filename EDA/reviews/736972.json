      "text": "Thank you Rehana resort for our lovely stay! We had a relaxing and enjoyable time in the resort.\n We had great fun in the pool/ slides and at the beach, snorkeling between colorful fish and corals.\nStarting with the room which has been cleaned every day, towels changed daylly, comfortable mattresses, bottles of water stuffed into dailly, food healthy and very tasty, had good fruits.  Drinks ok,  but for some one with high expectation probably not the place for them.\nStaff was so welcoming, friendly and helpful.\nGardens spectacular, with perfectly trimmed trees, grass,  pool area and beach area was cleaned everyday.\n A big Thank you to entertainment team that has kept kids happy with mini disco and adults with dancing and different activities.\nWill definitely recommend and return to Rehana!",

      "text": "Don't read any other reviews, just read mine and i will tell you why. It was our first time visiting Sharm-el-Sheikh (23 - 30 july 2023) and we chose this hotel. Me and my mom very liked this hotel. First of all i want to say thank you to receptionist Ibrahim he helped us so many times. He always advised us on where to go, what are the prices, what to buy and etc. We checked in very quickly in like 5 minutes. Our room was wonderful, every room has their own balcony. Next is food. Don't believe everyone saying that the food is bad, i don't eat meat but i always found something to eat. The swedish table contained prepared meals like meat, fish, vegetables, salads, pasta etc. There are not so many fruit options but they are yummy - oranges, melon, mango and grapes. Sweets are also a thing here, they are delicious but way too sweet for me. Drinks are - cold water, coca-cola, sprite, apple juice, pineapple juice, orange juice and alcohol drinks and coctails. The stuff are very friendly, i want to say big thank you to Big Boss in main restaurant, Mohammed from the Star Fish bar and animator Kimo. These are the people that were very nice to us through our whole trip. Rooms were always cleaned around 12-3 pm, water was given always two bottels 1L each.\nBIG THANK YOU FROM KAZAKHSTAN, I WILL COMEBACK, REHANA, I PROMISE",

      "text": "Worse experience ever. I don’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Let’s start with the welcome experience the staff in the reception has no experience whatsoever especially someone call ( Ibrahim ) I guest they are treating the guests based on  their nationalities . I got the lowest quality room that no one can you. Moving forward to the food quality and service. Staff priorities is their tools which is the only thing they care about like they get pressure from their leaders, better to describe them as ( Bosses) also the swimming pools aren’t clean no hygiene or cleanliness there are beach I dare you to swim there. Timing of everything I messed up like pool and beach timing lobby cafe. I don’t thing they have room dining and spa. It’s in their advertisement but actually nothing.\nIt’s hard to have one things in the right way. \nI never felt this bad in any other hotel. \n\nA lot more to say but I guess this enough to close this review.\n\nThank you Rehana for ruining my family trip.\nWe will never visit again.\n",
