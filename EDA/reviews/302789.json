      "text": "Our visit to Al Maha didn't go exactly to plan. But when they tell you \"we rarely make mistakes but when we do, we like to put it right\", I can assure you that they will go out of their way to do so. Indeed, our stay at Al Maha turned out to be one of the highlights of our holiday to Dubai. \n\nThe resort is modelled on a South African game lodge, with individual rooms set apart amongst the desert scrub. A golf buggy is available if you don't want to walk to/from your room. You're quite likely to see Arabian gazelle as you move around the property. The rooms are furnished in an Arabian style which may be too old fashioned for some. But they are roomy and well equipped. Each room has its own deck with a private pool overlooking the desert which is delightful for resting up between activities. The peace is glorious after the endless traffic noise of the city. The main sundeck is pleasant but didn't seem used much by overnight guests. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the activities we undertook. Animal sightings during a wildlife drive are likely to be limited to gazelle and oryx but staff will also fill you in on other aspects of the desert and the challenges of the area, eg the falling water table. The camel ride was well organised and the staff took some great photo and videos of us. Sundowners in the dunes - a delight, what more can I say! And as for archery - what an amazing teacher we had - I never thought I'd managed to get a dozen arrows in a row actually on target! \n\nWe didn't go hungry at Al Maha either. Breakfast consists of a cold buffet plus an extensive a la carte menu of cooked dishes. Lunch is a 3 course affair with dinner coming in as a 5 course menu (long trousers preferred for gentlemen). The food was well prepared and service was good. There's always teas, coffees and nibbles available in the lounge area. \n\nAl Maha is a very welcoming place, thanks to the wonderful staff. I have to call out the numerous South Africans who led most of our activities/transfers and for letting us reminisce about our years in SA - I hope we didn't make them feel too homesick! They were engaging, enthusiastic and curious  - we could have chatted with them for hours. And in the restaurant, Tracy was particularly warm and delightful. You will be warmly greeted by all of them as you move around the property. We're really grateful we had the opportunity to experience a stay at Al Maha.",

      "text": "An unbelievably fantastic experience. We stayed in Suite 35 last week. I am sorry that I cannot recall the names of our wonderful housekeepers who kept everything immaculate . We loved the Byredo toiletries , and the bed was incredible to sleep on. The room is as magical as the photos you see online\n\nAll of the staff we encountered were friendly and professional and genuinely wanted us to have the perfect time. We did !\n\nRoshan sorted our activities with Shawn who took us on an excellent wildlife drive. Roshan also kindly sorted a celebratory cake for my husband’s retirement- so lovely. And all of the restaurant staff were charming and very attentive- Tracey and Joel looked after us so well. The food was excellent both at the restaurant and in room dining. We really loved the mezze and also the tiramisu. And the fruit plate for dessert was magnificent. \n\nCannot wait to return as this experience is like no other.\n\nWe can truly say Al Maha has ma heart! Marc and Sarah",
