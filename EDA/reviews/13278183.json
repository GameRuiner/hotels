      "text": "Great modern hotel with awesome rooftop. Centrally located close to alot of the city highlights. Could imagine myself staying at the same hotel if I revisit this city.\n\nPrice it a bit pricy for what you get, but its kind of in general a pricy city where you have to pay a higher hotel price compare to other western cities in europe.\n\nBreakfast was a bit of a letdown since there was no really hot dishes. But this seems to be standard in Spain, So no biggie. \nI would probably skip the hotel brekfast and eat at some cafe next time.",

Rooms were good, staff were very friendly and helpful,  breakfast was relaxed and pleasant. It's not in the main touristy areas which is a real blessing - they are only a short and easy walk away. The park beside the hotel is nice to walk though and the beach is only a little further on. Would highly recommend. ",

      "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights during our first ever trip to Barcelona. Check-in was very smooth with payment on arrival, staff were friendly and welcoming. The room was small but just what we needed, it had all the usual amenities including a safety deposit box. However, it was missing a mini fridge! We also had a view of a brick wall, but we didn’t pay for a park view so it was to be expected.\n\nThe location was great, 5 minute walk from the metro but also walkable to many of the things to see/do in the city. The best part about this hotel is the rooftop bar, which has amazing views over the city and out to sea. It wasn’t fully open due to it being December, but we were able to take up drinks from the bar downstairs. We found the drink prices at the hotel bar to be very reasonable, unlike many other experiences we’ve had. \n\nWould 100% recommend and we will stay here again if we come back to Barcelona!",
