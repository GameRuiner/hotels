The location of the hotel was excellent, with trams and trains a short walk away, supermarkets nearly next door and an entertainment district with heaps of bars and eateries close by. The price point was 'spot on' for what you were getting.\n\nLook if you want somewhere reasonable, with Accor points and a great location go ahead and book it.",
