The room key was given before 3 hours ago, and it turned out that the air conditioner did not work and the room was very, very hot.  I had surgery in my eyes and I need to rest. However, I was treated as badly as possible, especially from the reception, as well as the room service. I am very, very sad because I adore Turkey and always love to visit it. Unfortunately, such indifferent and bullying employees reflect a negative image. I advise the hotel management to investigate the matter.  As a result of the operation, because my eyes need a cool atmosphere, not a hot one",
