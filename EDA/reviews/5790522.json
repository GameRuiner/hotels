      "text": "This is the first time I make a hotel review because I feel that this time it is really needed and I will be  honest.\nI have nothing bad to say BUT I would strongly recommend people to choose another hotel. Here is why:\nFirst of all I stayed 3 nights and paid EUR 400 per night (total for 3 nights = EUR 1200). That is the max I have ever paid for a hotel room. I thought it would be worth it BUT IT IS NOT! Far away from it in fact.\nThe room was small. When you enter the room you find yourself in the bathroom. You have the bare minimum. No shower cap, no pen, no notepad, no nothing!\nWhen I open my window there was a white wall in front. I felt in a prison. The hallway on the floor was sad and narrow.\nAlso I had the breakfast buffet only 1 day. They had great pastries from the bakery but I was shocked to find that the coffee pods are not next to the coffee machine. To get them you have to go to the reception! They keep the box there and they open it for you to choose your coffee and then you can go to the coffee machine! I felt like a school kid…\nIf you are looking for a small, clean, centrally located hotel and you don’t mind paying EUR 400 than I encourage you to go. But personally I think that it is way WAY too overpriced!\nIn conclusion: I did not get what I paid for and I felt cheated. I do not recommend this hotel.\nI recommend people to go in an Airbnb as hotels in Barcelona are too pricey.",

Our department in charge of complaints from our guests takes into consideration all comments published on our networks.\n\nWe have seen that your review has also been published on other portals and you had received a response, which is why we do not want to repeat ourselves excessively.\n\nWe have analyzed your case and we see that your reservation was in an economy double room; That is why the views from your room were focused on the interior patio of the hotel. These types of rooms are somewhat darker than the exterior ones. That said, we want you to know that we offer a 24-hour reception service and even if you wish, you can call us at any time without leaving the room. Our colleagues would have informed you of the cost of acquiring a room with views of the street.\n\nOn the other hand, the dates of your reservation passed just at the same time that the Mobile World Congress was taking place, one of the most important events in the city of Barcelona, where all the hotels in the city are at higher prices than normal due to the high demand that occurs.\n\nWe understand that on other dates the prices are cheaper but we firmly believe that on those dates, our offer is not as bad as it seems.\n\nFinally, comment that in all our ads, you will find clear and concise information about everything the room offers, along with its size. Photographs are even attached so that the client can have a clearer idea.\n\nWe can only emphasize that we take your comment into account and we hope to have the opportunity to receive your visit in our establishment again, and thus improve your experiences.\n\nBest wishes\n",

Before we arrived I had great communication with the hotel team who helped us navigate getting from the airport to the hotel. We had a gorgeous room compact but with everything we needed. Clean and fresh with a lovely view of beautiful Barcelona architecture. \nYes the street is noisy at certain times with cleaning and deliveries but what city street isn’t, and you should expect noise on a city break. \nVictor on reception was amazing, we had a passport stolen in Barcelona and he helped sort out what we needed to do to get a replacement. Nothing was a problem from Amazing restaurant recommendations to booking taxis to the airport. \nThe icing on the cake with this hotel is the amazing bakery on the ground floor. Cakes, sandwiches, pastries, pizza you name it they had it & all delicious plus great fresh coffee and orange juice. We would go back in a heartbeat! Well done Praktik Bakery you made our trip ❤️ ❤️❤️",

        "text": "Dear Tetyana,\n\nFirst of all we are really sorry for this unfortunate situation. However, two reservations were made under your name, which one of them was a no-show and following our policy cancellation we had to charge the penalty fee as you never notified us of not coming either a modification wasn't made. The typing mistake wasn't ours and Booking does not share the contact information of the guests, so for us it was impossible to know that your mail adress was wrong.\n\nAs we have discussed, our team contacted Booking to clarify what happened to your reservations and Booking made it clear to you and also explained it to you, that you indeed had two reservations .with us, so it is Booking whom you need to contact for any further concerns or assistance.\n\nAgain, we regret that this unfortunate situation happened.\n\nBest regard",
