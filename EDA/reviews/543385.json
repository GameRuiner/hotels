And how ever you had already paid for your hotel, we will charge you for another hotel” Sunotel Junior” and you should come back tomorrow and talk to the manager; \nWe paid double price for the cheaper quality Sunotel Junior hotel with the dirty small room, we could not even open the door of washroom because of awfull smell and not ventilated. No safety box, \nWhen client book a package, the 3rd party( agancy or,…) need to be in contact with other providers or the hotel should have some follow up when working in partnership with other agents/websits,….the next day, they reimbursed us the our 1st night with no price difference because of lower quality, so we went back to Sunotel Aston but all of those were such a headache after 19 hrs flight from Vancouver-Canada and above all of that they were not understanding and their treatment was so rude…..",

This is reflected in the positive comments we receive both onsite and online. We regret that your room was not in optimal condition upon arrival, and we promptly communicated this to you, offering a room upgrade to a higher category. We also regret that the complimentary wine offered did not meet your price expectations; it was intended as a gesture of goodwill. \nRegarding your comment about the fire hoses, please be informed that they are newly installed and currently under construction to comply with the latest fire safety regulations, which is a top priority for us. \nOur technical team has reviewed the wifi network, and it is functioning correctly. We have not received any complaints during your stay, and we have two fiber lines to ensure wifi coverage for our guests. \nDemanding a refund in exchange for not posting negative reviews online is unprofessional, especially coming from someone representing themselves as a hotel manager. Leaving without settling the outstanding bill is also not an elegant approach, as you have done. \nOnce again, we thank you for your stay. \nBest regards,\n\nAlbert Lopez\nHotel Manager",
