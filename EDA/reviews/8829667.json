Also near most of the tourist attractions.\nThe rooms are comfy and good but they don't have any hair conditioner or body lotion, only shampoo and soap. No view. TV quality was not the best bc it's placed through the mirror but you can connect USB. The staff are nice but not very friendly. The breakfast was various but not enough.\n",
