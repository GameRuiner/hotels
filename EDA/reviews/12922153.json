      "text": "Worst experiences. Will not recommend anyone. Weird smell in the rooms. Very dirty toilets. Staff was very rude. Requested them to serve the breakfast at 7.50 instead of 8 since I have to check out. But refused to serve even if it was ready. Neighbouring pub is very cheap. Whole night I was listening to drunk fights and hotel staff was also involved in it. I don’t know the reason but Staff was not ready to give me the invoice of the stay. Awful management.",

      "text": "It's was the worst experience in all my life, I booked 2 rooms for us and for our friends for 3 nights. But, as soon as you enter to the room you feel the sadness,  very dirty very ugly toilets and the KO was when we get trapped in the elevator, all of us trying to push the emergency bottom and nothing after minutes of terror we forced the door and finally it was opened. For sure no one was aware about that, no one came even to check what happened. This hotel can be rented to Hollywood for performing a horror movie.\nTo be fair, I want to note that the receptionist was extremely helpful and extremely kind and she accepted to cancel 2 of the 3 booked nights without penalty.\nThis property is outdated and it is clear that the owner doesn't want to spend any TL.\nDon't think to go there even for free. \n\n",

      "text": "We've travelled to Izmir to celebrate our engagement. We jumped into a taxi which took us to this hotel in the centre. When we pulled up outside the owner told us the price was 300 lira usually (which is a lie after checking online) but we can give you a discount of 250 lira a night. We said this is too exspensive and they said we have cheaper rooms which are 150 lira. We paid and they sent us to a room with so much damp, the walls tearing away. The bed linen was awful. The bathroom extremely dirty. The curtains seemed like they'd fall down if you pulled them too hard. To top it off me and my partner did not feel safe. \nWe asked if we could change the room and they showed us a similar room, all with the same problems. We told them we need to leave and asked if we could have our money back. They said this was impossible.\nPLEASE AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!",
