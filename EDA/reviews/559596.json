      "text": "This was my first time in Turkey and I couldn't choose better place. This was one of the best mini holidays that I had. Porto bello is an excellent and beautifull place. I had all inclusive and I couldn't ask for more. The room was much bigger than I was expecting, extremely clean and an amazing view to the mountains and beach. The lovely housekeepers were coming every single day to clean and change towels. I just forgot to mention that I am not good with highs ðŸ˜… so next time I will definitely request a ground floor apartment. The food was incredibly tasty, amazing, with lots of options. This was the best for me as I am a food lover. All the staff were very attentive all the time, friendly and they made me feel very welcome. My highlights goes to Patrick for such a brilliant host and entertairner as he is. Very good nigh parties, games and karaoke. The swimming pool and the gym are a must. My husband enjoyed every the gym every morning. Swimming pool really clean and warm water. I went to the spa and booked a couples room treatment. I have to confess that was one of the best massages ever. Unfortunately I have to say that the lady in the reception was really rude and not friendly at all. She definitely doesn't listen what customers are looking for and they needs. Sorry about is. I have over 15 years of experience in working in the best spas and hotels all over Europe, so sorry to leave this negative review. Was an incredible stay. You are the best. Thank you to the stuff who prepared the special table and offer a bottle of champagne for my wedding anniversary celebration. I'm planning already my next visit probably in the summer time.",
