      "text": "We booked our holiday as a reasonably priced getaway and unfortunatley things weren't as we had expected. On arrival we were not aware that we would have to self check in (our reference number didn't work) and that no one manned the front desk until 12pm and leaves at 8pm every day. Luckily as we landed at 11am and got to the hotel before lunchtime another guest let us into the lobby (as there is a code to gain entry) we waited for the gentleman staffing the desk to arrive and we asked if we could drop our bags at reception so we could at least explore rather than waiting 3 hours to check in ( the man on the front desk assisted us using the check in machine when we returned to chek in and also arranged us an extra key card). He kindly took our bags and we went out to explore the area. If you don't want to walk alot then this isn't the best place to stay. There are a couple of supermarkets in a short distance from the hotel, a small one and a bigger one for all your daily needs. \nThe hotel itself, unfortunately, was lacking in many areas- the sauna is not there to use any longer which we didn't realise when booking and the pool is only accessibly 12pm- 8pm when the desk is manned. The gym is generally OK but the cardio equipment stopped working on our 3rd day and didn't get repaired during out stay. The pool is very busy with teenagers and young children and is in between buildings so not that great for sunbathing as at times there is no sun reaching the area. It seemed that the locals came to use the pool too. The other quire disappointing thing was that there is a restaurant but it was never open so no option for meals here, only a vending machine I'm the lobby.\nThe room was fine it was clean and had a fridge, hob and microwave and some utensils so we made our own food at times. \nThe good thing about the travelling from the hotel is you can get a travel card from the tram stop by the hospital and it covers the metro/buses and tram for however many days you want to book a ticket for, we did 4 days and travelled to Barcelona on multiple occasions. \nThere are beaches with stones and without the further you go from the city pass the harbour about 1mipe down the beach is a better beach with a life guard and less people trying to sell you stuff when your sunbathing.\nWe visited the wax museum which was great fun and enjoyed eating at makamaka and another restaurant a bit further down both reasonably priced and great food. \nOther than these challenges we had a lovely stay and made the best of it, I hope this information is useful for your holiday if you are visiting and any questions feel free to ask. \nHappy holidays 😊",
