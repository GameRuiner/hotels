      "text": "This hotel has some positive points.\nThe staff are friendly and very helpful with a lot of support from google-translate.\nThe gym/pool is 5-star\nThatâ€™s about it.\nThe appearance in the public areas and hallways is shabby. There is a tremendous shortage of lightbulbs - darkness rules everywhere, in the public areas, hallways, bedrooms, even in the bathroom.\nThe rooms are large and empty. The bed/mattress is possibly the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced - like sleeping on a barely padded wooden box. The a/c offers two options: hot or hotter. And the window opens less than a  hands width, so welcome to the sauna (in December!!)\nBreakfast is ok - below average for Turkey.\nWiFi is not user-friendly, requiring repeated sign-in and is very slow.\nThe mini-bar fridge is no match for the intensity of the heat in the room - if you leave your bottled water in the fridge all day it comes out slightly cooled.\nThe bathroom facilities and toiletries and accessories and towels are good\nLocation overlooking a metro station - good for convenience, but a little noisy at times, especially considering that closing the window is out of the question.\nElevators ok",

The station is 2 minutes walk from the hotel.\n\nThe staff were friendly and I was quickly booked in. The room was large, clean and very airy with a good desk to work at. The bar and restaurant area is OK but nothing special but there are lots of places in the area to eat and drink so this is not a problem.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is a great base for business but not for a family holiday.\n\nI would definitely stay here again when in the area on business.",
