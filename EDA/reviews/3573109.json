      "text": "Overall a great stay at a good 4 star hotel (I am not sure it is a 5 star). The grounds are lovely, set over a number of levels leading down to the beach. Each level has a bar of some sort and some have 'snacks'.  The hotel is clean and tidy and in pretty good repair. Beer is ok and cocktails are pretty decent. I would probably recommend to others. \n\nMy wife sadly contracted gaestrentriatus on the 5th day of the holiday which spoiled the trip and our anniversary. She believes it was likely the Caesar salad at balisico but she is unsure. Certainly something from the hotel. \nThe pharmacist was ok helping get her the right medicine but she vomited for 20 hours and had diarrhea for 72 hours. \n\nAccommodation. Room 5226. The tiles in the bathroom have cracked and been poorly repaired. This makes it look pretty shoddy. There is only hot water (even from the cold tap), this makes showers almost unbearably hot. The safe is temperamental and takes a few attempts to unlock. The toilet flush can sometimes get stuck 'open'. The room next door can be heard through the adjoining door. Equally smoke could be smelt through that door as their room was a smoking room and ours was non smoking. Disappointing.\n\nThe grounds look a little tired in places. Cracks around the pools area/missing tile grout. Some sunbeds were broken. The pool towel hut looks more shack than building - not terrible but odd. \n\nSpecial mentions. The lifeguard at the relaxing pool and Ahmed at the waterfall bar. Both went above and beyond to ensure guests were both catered for and followed the rules. The Thai restaurant was superb, lovely food, good service - in fact all a la cartes were good and the buffet was acceptable by contrast. \n\nThe app was ok. It wasn't the easiest thing to use for booking restaurants but functional.",

We're vegetarian which restricts things and my wife requires Jain food which can make holidays hard work at times.  However, last time they were extraordinarily accommodating and with a young child we thought we'd go back.  \n\nI did wonder if the service levels would be as high this time round, but if anything they were higher.  Executive Chef Mohamed looked after us last time and he did so again this time.  He truly \"gets\" excellent service, has high standards and  gets onto your request straight away.  Apart from that, he is also a very nice chap!  I must also mention Mohamed Fadel who looks after the guests poolside.  He is also a credit to the Sunrise Arabian Resort.\n\nWhen you arrive, the front of house staff greet you with \"Welcome to home\".  I must say, they truly make you genuinely feel like a guest of honour.",

      "text": "12:52\n1 Apr 2024\nArabian beach is a good all inclusive hotel but not outstanding. The rooms were big, there were plenty of pools and loungers ( although we were low season) and various restaurants other than the buffet. The staff were friendly. Beds are hard, restaurants have a very difficult booking system especially when the wifi is poor, and don't work to capacity so empty even though they say they are fully booked. Food in the restaurants average not restaurant quality but ok. I would class them as restaurants that if I was paying I wouldn't return. Birds are all over the place landing on already cooked food as no protection around the cooking stations so the buffet was a no go for us, food on buffet poor. Lots of sunbeds but many reserved for people that don't turn up all day, probably because they tip the pool guy, we were low season so not a problem but probably terrible in high season. We went mainly for the diving and what can I say, in short my advice is find a different dive school don't use gold star dive school. We are all advanced divers with an instructor and dive master within the group so we have experienced many other schools over the world and this is got to be professionally the worst. We never had the same guide even though they insisted we did a trial dive to understand our ability. This was a waste as the next person had no idea our ability. We had researched the dive sites we wanted to visit and\nbooked these but when we went out\none day they refused to take us to\none of them due to current despite\nother boats being at the dive site. We ended up doing a boring dive just because the guy couldn't be\nbothered and sent us on the second\ndive with only the camera man. To\ntop off that day they stole my dive\nmask and the strap from my sons.\nNo one would take accountability for it so if you do go with these guys and have your own equipment don't leave it with them even though they say it's fine!",
