      "text": "I book this hotel for 2 nights (was planing next week to book more 2 nights as o have meetings in Dubai). Unfortunately i had issue with my card so i called 23rd of October to ask them not to cancel my booking and i will pay upon check in. The next day before 2 hours i arrived i send message i will pay upon check in, because i saw notification in booking that my card invalid.\nDespite of  informing them twice, when i reach hotel my booking was cancelled. And they offer me 5 star hotel rate for some special, last room. \nI didnt say anything and i left back to home which is almost 2 hours away. Nice try to trick people to do upsell as i have genius discount from booking. Very professional. By the way hotel in real is so far from pictures. Hope you will never book it even for business trip.",

      "text": "This hotel is the perfect definition of good from the outside but trash from the inside , Staff are not friendly , you pay for HOTEL PARKING (all cars keys are gathered at same spot that anyone can pick someone else car, no one even knew i picked my car keys ), wall is cracked and has some scratches, i am a patient person i was actually okay with all of that, until i saw cockroaches behind bedroom and inside toilet , you know the funny thing is that i saw old reviews and they also had cockroaches exactly like the ones i had , this shows that the hotel doesn’t care about something happening twice , do you wanna know something sad , this hotel can go from 1 star hotel to 5 star hotel just by getting more professional staff , if it was cleaned and decorated every once in a while , it will easily be a 5 star hotel",
