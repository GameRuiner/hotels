      "text": "This hotel is located a little away from the busiest tourist area but still a short walk to most places we wanted to visit. \nThe rooms are a bit small by American standards but clean and adequate. The staff was the MOST helpful finding restaurants, giving us suggestions/ information. Etc…. The breakfast each morning had a wonderful selection that was very tasty. The rooftop bar (pool area) had a lovely view and served a very good light dinner the night we arrived and were jet-lagged. We were too tired to walk anywhere…\nI would highly recommend staying here!",

      "text": "I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona. Great location, smart, professional, friendly staff and a very comfortable room. Got an email the day before arriving following up on my request for a balcony offering an upgrade to make sure we did get a balcony as the hotel was full over the Easter weekend. Yes it cost a bit more and yes it was an upsell but it meant someone was reviewing incoming guest ahead of arrival which is to be applauded. We accepted and were able to check in on arrival despite being a few hours ahead of regular check in. Little gift and a hand written welcome note were delivered later in the day. Excellent breakfast and although the hotel was full, there were no queues and everything felt relaxed. Only minor thing that could e improved would be the temperature of the hot breakfast offering. No one loves cold fried eggs.",

Clean tidy, good for us that the staff spoke good English and were welcoming. \n\nIt's situated very close to the a1 bus to and from the airport, and right near the gothic quarter and LGBTQ+ area, so lots of great little cafes, bars and restaurants.\n\nWhile it's on a main road, the double double doors for the balcony hide all the noise, maybe a little noise from the hallway occasionally, but as the hotel is small this was infrequent.\n\nRooftop bar is a nice spot and the breakfast was good.",

Bed was comfy and no noise from the road. \nLocation of hotel is perfect, breakfast had so much choice & staff were so friendly! And I enjoyed having a glass of cava with my breakfast! \nWe were able to leave our luggage on the day of the departure and the hotel ordered a taxi for our return to the airport.  \nWould definitely recommend this hotel & this is the best we have stayed at for a city break!
