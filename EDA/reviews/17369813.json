It was kept immaculately clean throughout the week. The beach and most restaurants were closed but we got to try out the spa which was wonderful. The hotel is very close to Bodrum center so it was easy to commute to all the restaurants that were open in winter. We will return in summer to take full advantage of this great hotel. ",

The wedding itself was beautiful but so was everything else. We were in touch via WhatsApp 24 hours a day and all our questions were answered and all our demands (and there were many of them) were met promptly. It was very sad to leave particularly because the weather was still nice.",

      "text": "I stayed at Bodrum Mett hotel during early september. I was going through a difficult time in my life so needed to get away for a few days by myself. I booked them by looking at the reviews here. I was greeted very warmly by my ambassador who took care of me during my entire stay. She arranged all my restaurant reservations, airport transfers and even helped me send a postcard to my friends back home. What a wonderful place really. The people who work there couldn't do enough for you. They obviously loved what they were during which was very easy to observe. The saturday party at Folie was a blast. I made so many new friends and had so much fun. The food at Attiko and Isola were both great. Both restaurants offered fantastic views of the ocean and the food were outstanding. If my travels bring me back to Bodrum again, Mett will be my first choice.",
