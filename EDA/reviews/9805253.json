      "text": "The hotel is quite dated but has a few modern areas and it would be a solid 4/5 if it wasnâ€™t for the staff ignoring all customers who donâ€™t tip over â‚¬5 for the simplest of things.  Having to fight with guests tipping ridiculous amounts for a coffee from 10feet away isnâ€™t sustainable and it became an all inclusive resort if you get it yourself.  The same staff arrogantly ignore you and service is only for big tippers. \n\nThis annoyance aside, itâ€™s a lovely hotel for under 7s plenty to do with the pools and beach is lovely and well maintained.  The rooms are meticulously cleaned by the most polite and respectful staff, if only this was the same for the restaurants.\n\nThe food is quite the same and very meat/veg orientated, itâ€™s aimed at Russian/European guests and lacks some international food options and certainly allergens. \n\nFilter Coffee is like Petrol so that gets you going in the morningâ€™s ðŸ¤£.\n\nKids events in the evening are good, always a cinema, face-painting and a mini-disco.  \n\nOccasionally bouncy castles are put out but these are swamped by bigger children who just hit your\nChild until they get off. \n\nThe pools are lovely but space around them is a premium, again it seems staff place objects on sun-beds and the loungers and you need to buy them, or go down at 6am and sit there like a moron till your family come down. Itâ€™s shameful and the management does not seem to care\n\n3.5/5 \n\nBig Cons- Money orientated staff. Food is quite samey.",

      "text": "The hotel is huge and beautiful. We enjoyed the vacation there. The staff is very friendly and polite. \n\nThe food was very good - there are multiple options to choose. Breakfast was a little bit weaker >> For example fruit option was only bananas, apples, oranges, and cantaloupe. I was missing some flexibility here. Also, eggs were made just like omelets and there was no other option. During all meals, the staff asked us what we wanted for a drink and they were very friendly and always smiling. \n\nOur room was daily cleaned and smelled good. In the fridge, there were always enough bottles of drinking water, Pepsi and Sprite. Also, we used safe for our passports and wallets. The bathroom is huge - there is a bath and shower. We had a room with a sea view and balcony, so in the evening we were resting there and enjoying the view. \n\nWhen we were on the trip or we left early in the morning they prepared for us breakfast package. It was always the same but better than nothing. \n\nThe pool was big enough, there was part with warmer water, part for very small kids, part for kinds with toboggans and part for the swimmer with cooler water. We saw that every night the pool was cleaned and also tested if the water was not infected. By the pool, the waiters were asking us what we wanted for drinks, which was very good because you didn't need to go to bar. \n\nEvery night there was a very good program prepared by the hotel. Singers, dancers, and a program for kids. \n\nThe beach was part of the hotel, there were beds with parasols. The beach was clean as well as the sea. \n\nOutside of the hotel, there are shops, so you can buy what you need. We can pay by card everywhere. \n\nFrom my point of view, I have just one negative and it is about wifi connection. It was really weak.",

Caution, older children, do not take, they will get bored here. We are a little disappointed that the pools are only open until 5pm at this time of year. Even an extra hour would have been good. The quality of the food was ok, the selection of alcoholic drinks disappointed us. The wine was essentially undrinkable. Mixed drinks with too much alcohol. If they had used good quality alcohol and followed the recipe, it would certainly have worked out similar in cost. The animation team were great. Massages great but quite expensive despite haggling. Cleaning was fine.\n",
