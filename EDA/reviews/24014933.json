      "text": "Let's begin with this hotel was around the corner from the famed  Casa Battló. We were steps from Las Ramblas, The Montjuïc, and Port Vell. So very well situated.\n\nThe hotel would easily be missed as it is a narrow entryway amongst many doorways and there is no doorman. Upon entry through automated glass doors there is a beautiful staircase or you can take the elevator up to check-in. Elevators in Europe are very small. Either two people or one person and a suitcase - keep this in mind always. We were early, so we did check in and our luggage was tagged and we had the chits. We took a walk and returned to go to the room.\n\nThe hallways were quiet, beautifully painted and black sconces adorned the walls. The room was SMALL and very tasteful. The bathroom was HUGE actually and had everything we needed - towels, hair dryer, tissue, soap, etc. \n\nThe bed was also huge and pretty much took up all the space. Comfortable for sure. The wallpaper was sweet and all the curtained areas made the space feel feminine, safe and nesty. \n\nThe wardrobe was small but did what it should. We had a fridge as well. One curiosity of the room was an enclosed balcony. It didn't FEEL like a balcony but I can't imagine what else it was. It felt like something from maybe the 1900s and I loved it! French doors, a writing desk and chair, and lamp. I kept my suitcase there. It looked over an empty parking area and up at I think apartments. At night, I closed the doors and pulled the heavy drapes to darken the room. \n\nWe had daily cleaning service and that was that. Clean, cute, well-located. The building next door housed a small supermarket if you need ANYTHING. Which was perfect.",

I and he let me choose the hotel and I was so happy with my choice this hotel was prefect!\n\nThe staff was great when we checked in early and we got to check into our room a few hours early! Which was amazing I needed a nap and shower after our flights from the states. \n\nOur room was my the elevator and we didn’t here much. Super comfortable and quiet room. Loved that it was cozy - yes it’s small but we don’t need too much of room since you are in the heart of Barcelona. This hotel is in a great location to restaurants, the sights, the metro, and of course shopping!\n\nThe bed was very comfortable and I loved that we could stream our HBO max from our phone to the TV. That made the room. \n\nNext door to the hotel is a little convenience store where we got late night snacks and water. \n\nI would totally book this room again!\n\nOh and loved the mirrors in the room so while my fiancé was in the bathroom I could finish my makeup",
