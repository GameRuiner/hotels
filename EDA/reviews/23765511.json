I would like to commend Shehzad Afridi for making my stay as smooth as possible upon arrival to smooth checkin until my departure. He ensured that my stay was entirely satisfactory along with Tahir, Mohit, Anita and Ismail from Thyme restaurant. I loved the clear vegetable soup and how the chef would prepare my sunny side up eggs just the way I like it. The staff were very helpful and the view from the balcony is breathtaking. Hopefully when I return the hotel pool  will be operational aside from the Movenpick pool but nonetheless it was definitely a relaxing weekend and I can‚Äôt wait to be back.",
