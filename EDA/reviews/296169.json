      "text": "Lovely little all inclusive break away for my birthday.\nWe couldnt have asked for anything more - beach, pool, scenary, nice food and attentive hotel staff. Perfect time to relax and recoup\n\nThe room we stayed in was very big with a beautiful sea view. Bed was very comfortable, the room would be cleaned everyday and mini bar was topped up each day. \n\nThe pool and beach were clean and very relaxing. We arrived at the start of season so it was lovely not having to many people around. \n\nShoutout to our waiter Samet who was very accommodating and attentive. We received amazing service from him throughout our whole stay. \n\nGood variety of food throughout our stay\n\nThe hotel was a short taxi ride to the marina, I would recommend taking a trip out. \n\nWould definitely return for a long stay.",

The food was delicious with a great variety, we particularly enjoyed the pastries and fresh salads.

      "text": "This hotel probably has the best views in Bodrum. All the public areas, the bars and restaurants have views across the bay towards the castle.  The gardens and walkways are beautiful,  with flowers everywhere \nUnlike it's neighbours,  this hotel had a beach, and the snorkeling is fantastic due to several banks of seaweed. I saw multiple species of fish. There was a constant lifeguard presence. We were brought drinks on the beach. \nWe particularly loved the fresh fruits  from the hut on the level above the beach, where you could also get ice-cream throughout the day. \nThe swimming pool was interesting,  big enough for water polo, but also interesting to swim around.  Far bigger than the pools at neighbouring hotels.\nWe loved the taxi across the bay, both in the day and by night. I would also recommend a walk along the city walls,  opposite the hotel,  with lovely views across both bays.\nThe spa and haman were lovely, and reasonably priced.\nThe staff were friendly but not intrusive. Good at remembering preferences and kind. \nThe food was good and interesting.  We always found plenty of options.  Salad bar was always interesting and well stoked. Cakes were beautiful. \nSo why not 5 stars? Although nearly perfect the room let it down. The bathroom had been refurbished and looked lovely but water temperature and pressure varied.  The main room furniture was tired \nThe wardrobe was too short for any of my dresses to hang without touching the floor. There were no drawers . The fridge was restocked every day, but door was slightly dodgy.\n\nIt was so nearly perfect..............I think however I wouldn't be able to afford it if it was!  Definitely recommend. ",
