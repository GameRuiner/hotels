      "text": "Stayed at the Hotel SERHS del Port for 4 nights while attending VMware Explore conference. First impressions was great, it was modern and very clean. Arrived at 10am but could not check in till 3pm but we could place our bags in the luggage room till later which was great. Room was spacious and clean. There was a complimentary bottle of water but no mini fridge which was only thing that let it down. My room was at the front looking onto the main road which was busy to early hours, so you may want to request room at the back if road noise bothers you. There was a wide range of options available for breakfast but it was 8am-10am, would have been great to start earlier as we needed to attend the conference by 9am. Hotel is in a great location as its next to Para-lel metro station and 5 minutes from La Ramblas. Hotel was also very secure as a room card was needed to get in or had to press buzzer for receptionist to open.",
