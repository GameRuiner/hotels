      "text": "The location of the apartment is sensational - around from the corner is the Sagrada Familia - our appt didnt have a view of it, but some appts would. The view from the roof terrace is amazing - we went there twice in the evenings, a beautiful way to end the day\nThe staff are also very welcoming and friendly, the lady on reception explained everything to us very clearly. In addition, when we left behind some clothing and the lady on reception kindly contacted us to try and return it. \nThe appt itself is modern and very clean / comfortable. \nIf I had to make minor suggestions to improve it would be small things Eg 1) the coffee machine doesn’t have pods – you can buy them in reception but it would be a nice gesture to leave 2-3 just to feel at home immediately. 2) Cleaning – you can pay extra for cleaning service, however in all the other appts we have visited there is a daily change of towels and cleaning the kitchen 3) You cant leave luggage when leaving – there is a service you have to access – these things aren’t a big deal, its just the difference from feeling a little bit special on a luxury appt Vs feeling like a budget hotel where every attempt is made to minimise the cost of your stay. \nSo in summary I would say \nLocation, the appt, the staff – all amazing. The little touches that make you feel special ? – missing.",

They were friendly, helpful, and professional throughout our visit.\n\nThe property itself was clean and well-equipped. It is located at a convenient location that is close to many eateries and supermarkets, and within a short walking distance of the tube/metro station. We were also able to store our luggage with the front desk for our early arrival before the room was ready.\n\nOur apartment room was spacious and clean with a nice view of the Sagrada Familia. The apartment room was so comfortable that it was just like a home away from home. I would highly recommend this apartment hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay in Barcelona.\n",
