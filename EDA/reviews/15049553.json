Food was ok but wouldn’t rate it amazing. Bar tender and desk staff very helpful,  Shame I can’t say the same about the porters. \nMy son who has aspergers got trapped in the lift in the pitch black which the porters found extremely amusing and literally couldn’t speak through laughing which I found absolutely disgusting. I would never return and I wouldn’t advise anyone else to stay there either. ",

      "text": "Most of the opinions are positive and the truth is that our stay was lousy; We arrived late and tired (family of 6 members) and our rooms were separated by 2 floors (108, 208 and 402). All the finishes in 8 are above the restaurant and all the conversations are heard and they bother until 12. At 4 in the morning we woke up with what looked like disc music from an adjacent building. At 6 we went down to breakfast and still heard. \nThe rooms are spacious and clean but tiny baths but one of the rooms stampled to tobacco.\nDinner and poor and limited breakfast. If you take away the pickles, the two types of fruit and bread, there is hardly anything left to choose from.\nIn such a big city, you can easily find better options",
