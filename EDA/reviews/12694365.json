I travel very frequently, and this hotel might be one of my favourites. The staff couldn't be more kind. The cheese and wine happy hour is fantastic! Their rooms are very comfortable and clean. Breakfast is great. Cocktails are delicious. Could not have asked for a better stay.",

We were on the front so slightly noisier if you leave your windows open but the rooms are super quiet otherwise. Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and the staff were really friendly. Will definitely be returning!",

The hotel is beautiful and minimal. Our room was great. Instantly relaxing free from clutter. \nThe beds and pillows are super comfy. We stayed in a room that overlooked the passage. Noisy in the day so not ideal if you need to sleep or take a nap. But it closes at 11pm until 8am. The spa was heaven and my partner had a massage which was not only relaxing but the masseuse took the time to explain allot about what he was doing and how to rectify ongoing issues. We will definitely stay here again.",
