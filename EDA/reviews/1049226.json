      "text": "- Sunfactor had booked an extra night than necessary since departure from the hotel was at 10:55 PM, and we therefore did NOT need to stay another night. A waste of money.\n\n- There were problems already at check-in as the hotel said the trip was booked through Masters Travel Service in England (which was probably booked by Espaceaway/Sunfactor) and we were registered as English guests, for which different prices applied than if we were Danish guests. How is that even legal? Not the best way to start a 5-star vacation. However, the next day they took pity on us, and we were allowed to stay at the hotel without extra payment.\n\n- It was nearly impossible to get even one sun lounger before breakfast, and ALL the hotel's towels had already been lent out, so they couldn't provide any for several days. It's almost like having bought access to a buffet but the restaurant has no more cutlery.\n\n- Smoking was allowed almost everywhere outside - really disgusting, not least for our children.\n\n- The main restaurant was packed, and there was an insane amount of noise, not least because of the really bad acoustics.\n\n- The waiters kept walking around asking if one could exchange their euro coins for Egyptian pounds. Really inappropriate to constantly disturb guests with these problems.\n\n- The waiters did not hold back when you walked by with your family - they definitely always thought they had right of way. At a \"5-star\" hotel?\n\n- A waiter demanded a review from us on Google Maps while making sure we gave the hotel 5 stars. Really inappropriate - and that review was of course deleted later.\n\n- The WiFi was incredibly bad, really slow, and at the pool, there was no signal at all.\n\n- The \"associated\" beach is about 700 meters away, so you have to walk there in the scorching heat, if you can bear it.\n\n- There were incredibly strict rules about what was allowed and not allowed on the water slides. Some required wearing a t-shirt, others did not; some required a glide mat, others did not. None of this was naturally described but was explained by a snarky and cheeky lifeguard.\n\n- They CONSTANTLY whistled in their lifeguard whistles at both the bathers and each other, greatly annoying EVERYONE who was just nearby the pool trying to relax on their vacation.\n\n- The air conditioning in the room did not work, the minibar was only refilled when you \"bribed\" the maids, and the remote control had no batteries.\n\n- Tobacco smoke wafted up and into our suite from the room below.\n\n- The hotel's associated nightclub played very loud music until 2 AM, greatly annoying all the surrounding rooms.\n\n- One of us got, of course, a 5-star stomach upset and had to spend the last few days in the room.\n\n- The hotel's kiosk does not operate with visible prices, and you know you're being ripped off both by the tourist prices and their exchange rate.",

      "text": "Having just returned from 10 days away at Steigenberger Aqua Magic I can honestly say that this is the BEST all inclusive hotel we have ever stayed at. So much to do for children with the water slides, pool areas and activities throughout the day as well as an adult only pool on the roof top and spa. The private beach is also beautiful. There‚Äôs an excellent choice of places to eat and drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we particularly liked that you could eat lunch at either the buffet, Italian or beach restaurant which makes a change to most hotels where you only have the option of buffet. We ate at all three a la cartes during our stay but have to say that the magic sky restaurant was our favourite. The fillet steak was delicious and cooked exactly how I asked for it. The hotel was very clean and well maintained throughout with plenty of staff onsite. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our only gripe is that we weren‚Äôt staying for longer. This hotel really does tick all the boxes and we certainly hope to return.",

Special mention to Gerges, Mahran and Ahmed Safwat who were fabulous and helped with any query we had going above and beyond every time.\nMain restaurant is busy but good varied food and special mention to Yasser who beamed from morning to night. \nA la carte restaurants were superb, especially Palappas, special mention to Keralos and his flambee lobster.\nSky restaurant was a beautiful rooftop setting. Samir Sabry and Mamdouh Ahmed made it so special. King prawns and br√ªl√©e particular favourites.\nReception bar light and airy and Yousef Sabry a joy to see. \nHousekeeping great, very clean room, pools and communal areas, beautiful gardens on the short stroll to the lovely beach with free pedals and canoes and beach bar with restaurant all included.\nPool attendants find you the best beds and set everything up for you, moving sunshades as the sun moves around! Mohktar and Mohammed Sayed were particularly helpful. Unlimited cocktails brought to your subbed. Don‚Äôt be put off by thinking it‚Äôs only for families. The rooftop relax pool is so quiet and the lazy river great for a float around the complex. \nAll in all, these people really want you to have the best time ever and therefore, thanks to them, we did.
