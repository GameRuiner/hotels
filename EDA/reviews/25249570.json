It was one of the best lunches in Dubai, many thanks to the waiter Zayn, simply perfect service and knowledge of the dishes on the menu, as well as general information about the hotel itself. I was also pleased with the presentation of the dishes, and the dishes themselves were delicious. My favorite is chicken satay, and the angus burger is simply beyond praise - my son was delighted! Thanks again to Zayn for the warm welcome, and we will come back here again and again!",

Hestons was our absolute favourite and I wish I had the gentleman‚Äôs name who looked after us as he spent so much time with us - talking about the food and showing us the restaurant.He took us to meet the head chef and showed us how the kitchen worked -which was just fabulous. Jaleo was also good fun.  Rakhmatjon at Milos was absolutely fabulous - he advised us on the food and bought us out a yogurt based ice cream to try that we never would have thought to order ourselves -but was a taste sensation. \nNobu beach was lovely and we were welcomed every morning by the lovely ladies who showed us to sunloungers and then we were looked after all day long by a fabulous gentleman and bought lemon and mint ice shots during the day - we felt very pampered.\n\nAll of the staff at the Club lounge were amazing. Kyle made us welcome from the moment we walked in and he has a fabulous energy about him, there was another gentleman who wore the same style suit as Kyle and I am so sorry that I didn‚Äôt get his name but he always had a smile and made us so welcome. Also Champoo and Khairy who went the extra mile. It is a fabulous quiet sanctuary in the hotel and combined with the relaxing atmosphere was a little hidden gem within the hotel. we would  book the club lounge again. Beautifully looked after and the food was fabulous. We didnt get to say goodbye and thank you - but I am sure we will see you all again.\n\nThank you for the invitation to the cocktail hour at Le Mar - it was really lovely to chat to Aicha and the view from the balcony was amazing.\n\nThank you also to the very hard working housekeeping staff who kept the room spotless. Such an absolutely stunning hotel and we really enjoyed our stay.\n\nIf you are reading this review it will probably be because you are pondering staying at this hotel. Just book it would be my advice. I am not sure if I'll ever quite be able to top my stay here.\n\nMy tip would be to book the club lounge as its a hidden gem within the hotel and a sanctuary of calm - where the pampering is unbelievable.",

I spent the day by the pool, which is located next to the \"Nogu\" restaurant.  Starting with the service, then the hygiene, and the food crowns it all.  And what convinced me that the management cares about its guests who want peace and will pay for it, is that children under 21 are not allowed in this pool.  Several times mothers with small children came but were kindly reminded that children are not allowed in the pool.  First pool where I didn't give my hard earned money to listen to someone's loud kids.  Bravo !  I hope it will stay like this.",
