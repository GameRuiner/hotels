There was fun entertainment every afternoon and the animation team took very good care of us even when going to the clubs I Naama Bay. The food could have been better. The hotels location was very beautiful and so was the beaches and the coral reef. We got what we came for and more. Highly recommended.",

Hotel workers are very friendly and helpful. Rooms spacious, clean and with comfortable beds. Especially pleasant was peaceful atmosphere. Animators were good not, pressing, quite balanced. In some hotels they are too  clamorous and very noisy.  Still at nights music could be not so loud. For example  skirt dance and etc should have Egyptian mysterious more quiet  music.  We recommend this hotel very much for people who like relaxed peaceful vacation.  We would like to return.  Please maintain reefs. People should be already in reception informed not to touch and not to walk on corals. Some people did !\nAlso please maintain silent peaceful atmosphere. Thank you very much.",

      "text": "After some hard life period I was looking for a place, where I can find some peace and don't worry about anything.\nAnd this resort was exactly the place I needed. End of February is also the perfect timing for someone like me: it's not too hot (+25 - +27 Celcius), water +22 and a lot of sun.\nThe hotel is kind of surrounded by the sea, so there are 3 beaches and they are oriented differently, so when it's windy on one side, you can go to another one.\nThere are also 2 pools, the \"warmer\" and the \"colder\" one.\n\nMy room is quite large, simple and nicely furnished, it's probably kind of oriental inspired design. There is a locker, which is free of charge.\n\nThe local food at the restaurant is a mix of different cousins. Sometimes I wished to have more local dishes. But there was an Egyptian evening that was great.\nAlso once you can visit the local Lebanese restaurant. One visit is included in the price, but a reservation is needed.\n\nThere is also a diving club on the territory, a gym, a beauty salon, spa, souvenir shop and even a tattoo studio. I had a massage, I asked for a harder version and it was perfect!\n\nAll the staff are very nice, very friendly and pay attention to you, Once I missed the breakfast and at lunch I was asked, if everything is fine. I think, this is cool.\nAlso the staff who is working at the territory, take care of the green areas are very welcoming and you also see the clean clothes and shoes. It seems that they have a good work conditions.\n\nI would wish to have some more explanation and maybe a small tour at the beginning. Because some of the thing I discovered at the end. Like the food at the corner, that you don't suffer waiting for dinner 😏\nAlso some announcement about the evening plans would be very helpful. Because there are some activities, but you learn about it somehow randomly. \n\nI had an amazing experience there, could recommend it to anybody.",
