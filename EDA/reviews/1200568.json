      "text": "Good aspects include cleanliness and a convenient location close to Mall of the Emirates and the Metro, facilitating easy access to shopping and transportation. \n\nHowever, the hotel is marred by several negative aspects. The service is notably slow, affecting the overall experience. Furthermore, interactions with some staff members can be unpleasant due to their rudeness, which detracts from the hospitality expected at a hotel. A particularly disappointing aspect is the hotel's apparent stinginess in service, which is palpable and diminishes the value of staying here. These shortcomings contribute to an overall impression that this is among the least satisfactory 3-star hotel experiences available in Dubai. Despite its few positives, the negatives heavily overshadow, making it difficult to recommend for those seeking a pleasant stay.",
