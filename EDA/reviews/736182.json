      "text": "Stayed for 6 nights 2 adults 1 teen and a baby 16months, \n\nI will start with the pros \n\nStaff: Were really friendly, Mohammed at breakfast, lunch & dinners was amazing especially with my baby daughter, always got a hello from various staff members as well. \n\nRoom cleaned every day and topped up with water bottles and tea/coffee. AirCon worked. \n\nCons \n\nThe hotel was being renovated and was more of a building site this was supposed to be completed before we arrived which was stated on our booking site, as a result the main restaurant was closed, and the 2 luxury pools with swim up bars were closed also. \n\nBreakfast, lunch dinner & bar snacks were limited, it felt basic and repetitive, I think this was due to the main restaurant  being closed. \n\nEvery day we had to lug the babies push chair up to the smaller restaurant 2 flights of stairs, as there is no lifts anywhere. \n\nAqua park area wave pull was never on, and some of the rides are switched off, babies pools were too cold left our 16 month old shivering!\n\npool bar & bars was our main disappointment, beer warm!! And wasn’t through a beer tap, it came out of a bottle in to a small plastic cup, any left over beer was left on the counter for the next person. \nNo drinks fountains only option were sprite and Coco-Cola also out of a bottle and warm.\nNo cocktails either \n\nEntertainment wasn’t very entertaining barely anyone went to the shows. One night 1 of the animation team (male) wore a red wig and went around trying to kiss men.\n\nBeach shared with 2 other Parrotel hotel  chains which were luxury, but unfortunately our hotel beach bar was low standard pretty much the same as the pool bars in a rickety shed!\n\nFinally mosquitoes both me and my teen daughter were stung every where, it was uncomfortable I don’t normally have this problem going to hotels, around the world. We used spray but with limited effect, hotel probably needs to implement spraying bushes and get rid of stagnant water to help that. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis was my first ever review of a hotel, I don’t tend to leave reviews but I will make this an exception. \n\nI have been to enough hotels to be able to write this review on an all inclusive basis. So I believe it’s an honest review, I had also done my research on the hotel using trip advisor, and believed it was a good hotel although being a 4 star the reality was more like a 3 star, I hope this was just a one off and I don’t know if this was the time of the year, but however contributed to a-bit of stress & boredom \n\nI had also asked to swap hotel to the one over the road Parrotel beach resort as it was beautiful passing through, but I got no response from Parrotel head office. \n\nIf you are on a budget and are just using it to stay while you explore I would say book, but if you wanted a rest by the pool this hotel wasn’t ideal for when we stayed. March \n\n.",
