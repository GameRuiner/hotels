      "text": "Details are very important in hotel business. I had three weird experiences in this hotel. \n\nFirst, you just get one keycard. I was with my family and I usually wake up early. You need to knock door everytime to get back in room and wake up everybody. I demand extra keycard and their response was, \"We have just one keycard for everyroom, we can assist you to open door with mastercard.\" It is ridiculous. Details!\n\nSecond, we ran out of toilet paper. So, I asked reception for extra toilet paper. How normally a receptionist should response? \"Ofcourse, immediately we fulfill your demand\". The respond I get was, \" In couple of hours house keeping will clean your room, and put extra toilet papers\". I had to explain them I need it now, ridiculous. Details!\n\nThirdly, if a hotel employee is sincere about being nice and kind, he/she should be nice and kind all the time. First day acting nice and kind, the next day acting snob and bossy is not right. The lady works at bar and restaurant area did exactly like this. Ridiculous. Details!\n\nBesides, these bad experiences, good things also exist. Hotel location is very good. Rooms and generally facility is clean. Breakfast is over average. The gentleman works at hotel door who welcomes you, is one of the kindest person. He talks kind, acts kind and he is doing best to fulfill guest demands. I personally thank him.\n\nThese little details damage the standards and quality of hotel. In my next visit to Izmir, probably I will consider other hotels with same price.",
