The beach is very nice, lots of entertainment  and activities during the day. Snorkelling is a must! Beautiful. Food was ok, wouldn't say great but there was always something to choose from. At no point we felt sick. Italian a la carte restaurant was very nice. Drinks - only Egyptian brands included with All Inclusive which taste very different what we are used to. But good value for money. Hotel staff are absolutely amazing and made our holiday a very enjoyable experience. Restaurant/Bar/Animation and Reception Staff. Well done. \n Always smiling and helpful. Housekeeping and evening entertainment need a bit of improvement. Overall we had a lovely holiday, we met some great people at the hotel and weather was everything we wished for.",

The Reception staff were very welcoming and hospitable and even upgraded our hotel room, which was very nice, clean.  \nA big thank you to  Sayed Khairy, Khaled and all the staff in the restaurant who were very friendly and accommodating. I must say the food was nice, so overindulged, but who cares when you’re on holiday!  If you fancy something different,  there is also a Fish Restauran & Italian Restaurant that you might enjoy but you need to book this at reception.  \n\nI can highly recommend this resort as I felt safe, comfortable and the surroundings were lovely and I would definitely come back.",
