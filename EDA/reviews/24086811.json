      "text": "Overall, this hotel was good for the money I spent, and I only stayed 2 nights.  The location was good and near most attractions. \n\nPros - Food: There is a restaurant onsite. Breakfast was included with my stay, but the food options were very limited compared to most other hotels I've stayed at in the past. Dinner options were not expensive, and the food was delicious.\nStaff: staff were always friendly and helpful. \nWi-Fi option: Wifi was included at no extra cost and worked well.\n\nCons: Noise level: The hotel is very close to a mosque and my room was definitely not soundproof because I heard every call to prayer loud and clear. \nRoom: My room was non -smoking but my neighbor definitely was smoking in the room next door. Also, the rooms are not modern and would benefit from an upgrade. My bed was pretty hard but was ok for the short time I was there.",

No sunlight and the walls were cold, possibly because of the water pipes in between the walls. The wife never worked from the room, it worked only from the main door area .",
