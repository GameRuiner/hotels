And as can be expected from the Ritz Carlton, the standard of service is unsurpassed anywhere. \nThe set up is laid out extremely well with an endless range and variety of dishes and it is designed so that there is no crowding despite the high popularity of the Iftar. There are several cold stations, hot stations and a plenty of delicious sweets. The Chefs at the Ritz Carlton are clearly excellent and there is no dish that is disappointing. \nIf you want to please your family and friends, book them for a lovely Iftar at the Ritz.",

      "text": "Stayed here on business for a day, then came back a few days later for almost a week.  Typical Ritz Carlton - some good and some bad. Good customer service.  Nice lounge but it was overcrowded every night. It is somewhat small and often there was no place to sit. The driveway/drop off infrastructure is terrible. Always takes a while to drive in due to traffic and it’s a chaotic mess when you finally get in.  The guys working the valet are great, very friendly but the situation they have to work in is crazy. The rooms are nice, clean and modern.  The laundry and housekeeping staff were friendly and attentive. The breakfast is excellent with lots of selection. This is the first Marriott brand hotel I’ve stayed at that didn’t credit my Bonvoy points/night stay in a day or so after checking out.  It’s been over a week and even after several emails to the guest relations team and the front desk manager, still nothing. Looks like I’ll need to call the titanium elite Bonvoy service line to file a complaint to get the points/nights credited.  Shouldn’t be this hard - very disappointing.",
