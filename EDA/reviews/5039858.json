      "text": "Our Family of four ( 2 adults 2 teenagers) stayed at Double Tree Hilton Al Barsha for 7 nights.We booked the King two bedroom suite with Balcony with half board ( breakfast and dinner).\n\nFront Office:\nVery friendly and professional staff at the front office did our checkin super fast. We had help to carry our bags to our room and the staff member Rajendar who helped us was very professional and courteous.\n\nRooms:\nThe two bedroom suite was fantastic. Complementary water bottles (4) were provided. Airconditioning was perfect. The staff member Rajendar who helped us with the luggage also helped to explain all the facilities available in the room( iron , do not disturb sign , configuring the temperature etc ). We really appreciated that.\n\nCleaning:\nCleaning staff did great job. When we did not want the room to be cleaned they respected the sign and when we wanted the room to be clean they impeccably cleaned the room and there were ample towels and toiletries and we did not have to follow up on any of the aspects. Good job guys.We even had a surprise when they made beautiful art work with the towels and arranged nicely on the bed. We are attaching the pictures.\n\nBreakfast\n\nBreakfast was satisfactory. Kudos to the staff members who were preparing omlettes and catered to our varied wishes in terms of how to make the omelette. Special mention goes to the staff member Naktaya and her colleague who were very friendly , smiling and patient when preparing the omlettes  to all the guests. It was not an easy job. We had chicken sausages , baked beans , some Indian varieties ( semolina/pongal, veg fried rice etc ) and couple of juices ( orange , pineapple ). There were couple of good selection of desserts ( cakes and pastries ). They also had few varieties of salad and fruits. Overall the breakfast is ok + the omlettes which was the main highlight for us ðŸ™‚. We would like to commend the staff member Ate Chann for her professionalism and  friendliness  with always a smile and helping the guests.\n\nDinner\nWe were not happy with the dinner varieties as we selected half board. There was a fish soup platter , grilled chicken pieces , pasta and rice . Sometimes the rice was hard. The desserts were very good. Overall we do not recommend half board dinner.\n\nSpecial Mention\nThe staff members/managers   Bilbek Singh and Rajkumar deserve special mention for providing great service during breakfast  and for being very friendly and professional. They were recommending the places to visit and even arranged a special cake on our last day. That was a touching gesture.\n\nAll in all we recommend the stay in double tree Hilton Al barsha which is walkable from the mall of Emirates and we felt it was a safe area .",

We all enjoyed the breakfast and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially in getting the larger taxis for golf bags etc. They worked hard to make our stay very enjoyable and always had a smile on their faces especially the concierge, even when we had heavy rain cancelling one of our golf days they came up with great suggestions of what else we could do.",

Itâ€™s easy to get a taxi and there are plenty of shops close by including the mall of the emirates. All staff were very helpful and friendly. We had a few little issues with the hotel room but nothing major. Our room was a non-smoking room but on arrival it smelt bad of smoke in the room and corridors and when we alerted the reception staff, nothing was done about it. The breakfast was ok, nothing special but food was warm and had good variety. Our shower leaked and some of the lights didnâ€™t work in our room but nothing a little maintenance wouldnâ€™t fix. For the price we paid we couldnâ€™t complain as it is very good value for money and only a short 30 minutes drive from the main airport. I would definitely return to this hotel if I was to visit Dubai again!",
