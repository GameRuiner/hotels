      "text": "My husband and I went for a work related in Deira Dubai and we decided to stay in Fortune Pearl Hotel for 3 nights, since we check in we didn‚Äôt see anyone smile until check out. We booked for Queen bed with City view but when we checked in, the receptionist guy said there is no room available with city view and they said that they will check on next day and inform us but on the next day no one update us. There is club in 5 floor which is so much noise of music from 10 PM to 4 AM in the morning. We want to use swimming pool so we ask to the reception which floor of the swimming pool but no one informed us that swimming pool is closed after getting there one of the lifeguard said the pool is  closed. It was a worst stay we couldn‚Äôt have good rest, the facilities are not working and the staff are not follow up their job.",
