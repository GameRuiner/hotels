      "text": "I checked in on 27th December with my wife and child to celebrate my wife's birthday.  \n\nThe check in process was smooth and the lady was professional .\n\n After a few hours of checking in, our toilet flush was running water continuously and malfunctioning. I made a call in the evening to the reception who said he was alone and could not help me. I asked him how was my family to sleep through the noise, to which he replied its not even a problem and he could sleep through the noise and so should my family. After pleading he said there's nothing that could be done today and can only be fixed next morning. It was fixed next day. \n\nThe next day, after returning home at about 5pm we were shocked to hear HEAVY drilling right above our room. After a disturbed night due to the noise of the flush we wanted to sleep and rest so i called the reception askimg them to PAUSE the work just for half hour my child could sleep but they bluntly refused saying its outsourced workers and they can't intervene. How can anyone be so not understanding to just pause work for sometime. \n\nOn our 3rd day morning,  the workers were back outside 9am and I requested them personally to start a little later so we could be in peace till we left our room by 10.30am. \n\nPROS : Room is spacious\nVery good Location\n\nCONS: No cleaning service unless booked for 7days. We were not aware. \nYour used and clean towels need to be dropped and picked from the reception. ",

      "text": "Room size adequate for a couple staying 3 days. Plenty of storage space for clothing. With the added facilities of an Ironing board and Iron, hairdryer and a safety deposit box in room (which sometimes comes with a local charge). Kitchen facilities were ideal if you required to cook during your stay, with an oven, hob, toaster, kettle and all cutlery, plates etc too. Bathroom is a decent size and good lighting. Walk in shower itself was a good size but shower itself would have been better with more \"power\" and we always had hot water when required. There was Aircon available, but as we visited in December, there was no requirement for us to use it. The overall atmosphere of the Citadines was very relaxed and chilled, with plenty of open, community space. It is well decorated in a colourful, modern, minimalist style, which adds to the feeling of relaxation. We never ate breakfast at Citadines, so can't comment on it but the free gratis Tea and Coffee facilities in reception area was a nice little touch. Although our interaction with the staff was very limited during our stay, those times we did speak or contact them, we were dealt with very profesionally, politely, always with a smile and with great helpfullness, be it from reception, housekeepers or door staff. Location wise, the Citadines is located on Las Ramblas itself, which is obviously extremely busy. We had very, very little noise pollution, other than the sound of bells from the nearby Church/Clock Tower and the odd car horn but no loud music or traffic noise, however, we must point out our room was at the rear of the hotel and not overlooking Las Ramblas itself. This was our first visit to Barca and would like to return, in the not too distant future. If we do, we would possibly look to book an hotel more towards the Gothic area, only for walking difficulties due to medical reasons, however we would not hesitate to recommend the Citadines as a perfect stay, to any of our friends and family who were thinking of heading to Barca.",
