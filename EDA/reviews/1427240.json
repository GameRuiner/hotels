      "text": "room - 521\n\ngood points\n\nthe best part - we were upgraded to family suite from the regular suite that we had booked.\n\n1. room is large & comfortable.\n2. breakfast spread  is good.\n3. 10mins walking distance from mashreq metro station & 15mins walking distance from mall of emirates.\n4. very polite & courteous staff.\n5. \n\nnot so good points\n1. room over looks the adjoining hotel.\n2. though the breakfast spread is good but its the same most of the days. so you run out of options if you staying for long.\n3. the pool is not heated (atleast for asians temperature requirement) since its on the terrace, it gets colder with the breeze blowing. even after several request they could not get the heater working which was The Major Bummer.\n4. the shower cubicle in the room is tad bit small, so Plus size guest will have challenges in the space :)\n\nkeep up the good work team novotel. thank you for making our stay so pleasant & comfortable. cheers",
