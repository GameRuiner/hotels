The rooms, even though quite small, were nice and clean and very well equipped. \n\nWe enjoyed delicious breakfast at the courtyard with fresh coffee and Turkish tea served to us by the super nice and friendly staff. Big thumbs up for the omelette!\n\nAlso, guests are allowed to use the pool in a nearby hotel, only a two minute walk away. \n\nAnd not to mention that all the restaurants, nightlife spots, shopping streets and beaches are right at your fingertips when you stay at Villa Citronella.",

The hotel was nice and we had a very early start for a flight and the night team made sure we were fed and ready to go. The location is great, by the harbour and there are great views once you're there (the harbour). The old town streets are beautiful and buzzing in the evening with life. There is a bit of noise due to being in the centre of town which is to be expected, we were very pleased with our stay and would recommend it. \n\nNick and Beth ",
