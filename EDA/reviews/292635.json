Always something to eat. Good waterslides. Beds were all ripped... Room very basic. Done the job. Kids weren't impressed (2 teenager).... Which was part of the reason we chose this hotel.... We only went out to hotel entertainment a couple of times because the way it was set up.  Average.",

      "text": "Arrived to a busy and tiny reception desk with one member of staff to check us all in. Wandered around with cases to find our room and immediately had a really bad impression. The route we took presented us with the backs of the rooms granted but the grass was scorched with weeds and the paint was shocking on the building! Finally found our room (block 6), as far as you could get up the hill and that’s what if asked for however there was a humungous generator outside this block of room and we had no sleep that night. With ear plugs rammed in following nights we got used to it but sitting on the balcony was over shadowed by a loud hum! Our towels when we arrived were unbelievable, wish I took a photo. Very small hand towel and what I assume was 2 bath towels which in my book were more like hand towels and were all frayed at the edges (I’ve used better towels on my dog)! That improved but not by much! The dining room was crazy so leave it till late to go! Food was cold and in the evenings only one side of a small serving area was open so very limited choice to what I’m used to from a 4star. It was so busy with families but they were smoking and very loud and the drinks, vile and served in cardboard kids party cups which made them taste even worse. I have never written a review but this hotel was SO disappointing and leaves me wondering for such a busy hotel, why aren’t they spending more on the paintwork and gardens that are not front facing and invest in decent towels and at least some decent plastic cups not kiddies cardboard cups for cocktails and drinks. Sorry Cyprotel, that’s my honest view.",

Nothing was too much trouble, the animation team and the entertainment was amazing, lots of pools, water slides and sun loungers, great choice of food, the reception and front of house staff were great - honestly could not fault this hotel, especially for the price. The kids club for 4 years and over was also very handy, we even plan on going back once my youngest is 4! They even acknowledged it was my birthday whilst I was there and delivered a bottle of alcohol to the room which was a lovely surprise. Next time we will stay for 10 days instead of 7 as it wasn’t long enough! ",
