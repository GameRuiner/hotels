      "text": "I stayed there for a couple of days for a conference. It s a nice but medium hotel that needs renovation.  The room was clean and spacious, the view was very nice even from rather low floor. The furnitures are somewhat old. The bathroom was not in perfect condition I could day that it was clear that there is not improvement for many years now. \n\nThe elevators very dirty esepcially the windows outside, this is not nice at all.\n\nThe hotel say that it is a bussines hotel but the wifi was terrible, certainly not for business.\nSome people in the reception could not help in English and this is embarashing. Og coyrse ther are also people that tried to hard to understand and help, sory for not being able to mention by  name here, \nBreakfast was ok, nothing special however. \nthe location however is very nice, close to the coast and the busy pedestrian road with all restaurants. Friday and Saturday evening is perhaps a little noisy.\nOverall, I had nice stay but I feel that the hotel provides less than expected or advertised and as such I grade it as average. ",
