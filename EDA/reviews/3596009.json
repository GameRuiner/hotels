      "text": "The staff are amazing, I can’t thank them highly enough for their hospitality, attentiveness and kindness towards our group of 7. \n\nThe staff at the main bar and pool bar work so hard and always have a smile on their faces.\n\nThe rooms are cleaned daily to a high standard with clean towels, bedding etc all changed.\n\nThe food, not a good selection at breakfast especially for children it is more catered for European culture. \nDinner you can have pizza, pasta, burgers or shawarma, chicken burgers and chips (nice selection for British families) same with the evening meal there is always something you can eat, my family loved the food on the outside bbq.\n\nWe didn’t have any issues with our stay and will be returning next year\n\nI will say if you’re arriving check your rooms for bedbugs before you unpack as we seen 3 families with them whilst we was there. However we didn’t have them in any of our rooms nor did anyone we spoke to most days so I think it was just unlucky for the people that did experience them and could have possibly have brought them in themselves with their luggage from the plane etc",

      "text": "We stayed in Family room with two terrace, rooms were nice and lots of space for all of us. Our children are 6 and 8, they loved pool (heated) and aqua park. The smallest child was banned from the aqua park because she is not so tall as they think she needs to be. It was surprise for us that she can't join with us. She have been taking swimming lessons two years and was there with two adults. She was crushed because waited the holiday and all the fun in the aquapark. \nOur room was next to children pool, the location was ideal for the children. The only negative thing about the location was DJ so loud music that is was unable to be in the room. The non-stop music was all the time when the aquapark was open. We ask to turn the volume done but the DJ just said that this is his job and can't do nothing, reception said the same thing. Every day all day maximum volume rave music. \nI would love to visit this hotel again some day but first will ask the hotel if they still have the DJ service around the aquapark.",

      "text": "We have just come back from a week's stay, 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 children. We arrived around 830pm and check in was quick, we were offered a drink whilst filling in forms. The bell boy took our suitcases to our rooms and we went to grab a quick bite to eat as the restaurant was closing at 9pm. First impressions on the food wasn't great but it was the end of food service so not much left to choose from. \n\nThe rooms were absolutely fine for our needs, beds comfortable and room clean. The cleaner Ahmed was great, he cleaned our rooms well and did towel art for the kids each time. \n\nFood is the only thing that let's the hotel down, it is geared more towards the Russian and Egyptian guests so I'm sure they ate very well. That being said we never went hungry and always found something to eat and it was nice. The snack bar at the aqua park is basic, chips, hot dogs and nuggets but kept the kids happy. Maghed ensured we had drinks when needed. Drinks are OK, I had a few cocktails and hubby mainly drank the beer which I think is egyptian Stella. \nThe Indian restaurant food was really nice however the range isn't great, don't expect a proper curry but what they do provide is tasty. The Italian was ok, hard to get pizza and pasta wrong!\n\nThe aqua park is amazing for the kids, the lifeguards are quite strict but it's to be expected when it gets so busy. The towel guys were great, tip them and they will reserve your sunbeds. The main pool is lovely and warm but the floor is slippy in that area. \n\nThe waiters are all very friendly and attentive and constantly asking if you need a drink. We tipped well so not sure if this impacts that. They sang happy birthday to my daughter and made a fuss of her.\n\nBeebo in the perfume shop is a top guy, helped us out a few times with different things, genuinely a nice bloke. We bought some perfumes and aftershaves and he provides a personalised service and prices are good. The guy in the jewellery shop is also nice, my daughter broke her phone and he took if for fixing one night and it was back the next day! Check out his lovely pandora jewellery, all reasonably priced. \n\nThe spa was excellent, I had 4 massages by the beautiful Sabrina, really lovely woman. Made me feel at ease and enjoyed every single massage she did, best masseuse I've ever had. \n\nIt was my daughters birthday whilst there so we booked a boat trip that day with the rep on site, Rambo, was an amazing day. We had 3 stops including the white island. My husband, daughter and her friend tried scuba diving, the girls didn't manage to do it as they struggled to breathe underwater, the diver who was with my daughter wasn't very patient, her mask kept leaking and he just kept pushing her down so she demanded to get out as felt uncomfortable. Hubby enjoyed his dive tho. I can't swim but the snorkel guide took me into the sea on my own with a life ring and showed me the coral, was very patient with me and I felt safe with him. I'm glad I got the experience as it was beautiful, like another world down there!\n\nOnly watched 1 show which was ok, the kids disco is very repetitive and only lasts 30 mins but my youngest liked it. Didn't try kids club. The violinist is amazing who does a little act at the main bar 1 night.\n\nOverall we had a lovely holiday however I don't know if we'd return to Egypt as the unwanted attention from Egyptian men was unbearable for my daughter and her friend. From stepping out of airport it was horrendous, shouting, staring, whistling. They were going for a walk out of the resort one day and only gone 5 mins when cars were beeping and men shouting at them asking for their number, they came back as felt unsafe. The men at the resort were more respectful, just saying they were beautiful ect which is fine. Mosquitos are out in force, make sure to buy some OFF repellant.\n\nAlso on my daughters birthday, someone from reception knocked on her room and presented her with a birthday cake, it was unexpected but a lovely surprise!\n\nThe hotel is great and I would reccomend to others, just not sure we would return to Egypt.",
