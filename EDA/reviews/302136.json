      "text": "Hi what can i say went 3rd march for 10 nights, stayed in 2320 (lovely room pool view and ocean view)  it was paradise the staff couldnt do enough for you Mohammed Ali (pool waiter) amazing allways polite and kepy us topped up all day and always smiling well done.\nMohamed on the beach so polite again and always there to help with beds.\nMain resturant was nice but busy food was very tasty, but the smaller resturant (by the beach) had the same food but quieter,  you can also have breakfast there.\nBeach bar for lunch couldn't fault it food was brilliant fish and chips a must.\nTwo resturants you had to book for in the hotel well worth a go again food was lovely and staff were awesome.\nMy advice for tips take dollars they love the notes, you look after them and they will look after you.\nBeach might be worth taking rubber shoes for the sea alot of shells but dont let this put you off its lovely and plenty of beds on the beach.\nMini bar in room you have to pay for so beware.\nThanks to the cleaner who helped us and sharaf (reception) we had a little issue and they both helped us thanks again.\nMy wife and I would just like to say a massive thanks to all the staff for making our holiday so special,  we will be back next (sharaf i'll be in touch)\nMr + Mrs Morris 2320",

      "text": "Just back after a week's break at the Iberotel Palace. I can thoroughly recommend it as a place to stay this being my fourth visit after a number of years away. \nI read several reviews before returning as it had been some time since I was here and can say that the negative reviewers seem to have visited somewhere else. \nMy only surprise in visiting this hotel is that the number of British visitors seems to be less. I cannot fathom why. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking an unhurried, quiet, warm and since children under 16 aren't accommodated, peaceful holiday. We had ample choices of food and plentiful quantity and quality of drinks.\nIf I had gripes these would be matters beyond management control such as the fairly chaotic security arrangements at the airport and my own oversight regarding insect repellent. Havng been previously in January or February biting insects were not a problem, however peak season for sand flies is March/April and I hadn't brought repellent, my fault not the hotel's. \nI am a bass player in a group  and duets of singer and guitarists singing to backing tapes are not \"bands\"! However none were bad at what they did perform and the plentiful food and drink compensated. \nWe didn't undertake any trips or excursions so can't comment on those but The Old Market is literally on the doorstep and we did cross the street to visit.",

It was a joy to find that all the good things about the hotel that kept us going back were still available, which includes the  exceptional service and friendly staff too many of whom to name individually \nCustomer Relations Manager Mr Youseff went out of his way to welcome us back and made sure our stay was comfortable.\nThe food was exceptional and had to complement the chief especially on his Lancashire hotpot. The Irish coffees made for us whilst watching the evening entertainment went down a little too well.\nOn arrival we were allocated the very first room we stayed in at the hotel which shows the detail that goes into ensuring your stay is stress free. \nA  one minute walk from our room to the lovey sandy beach for an early morning swim, and then breakfast, what more could you ask for.\nRooms still comfortable, hotel exceptionally clean, Old Shalm market just across the road for an evening stroll.\nWe will be retuning soon!",

What made this, our 3rd visit memorable was the exceptional care and kindness when I had to have an emergency operation whilst at the hotel   Literally, nothing was too much trouble for the management and staff. The reception staff, particularly Farouk was so helpful.  The Guest Relations Manager Mr Mohamed Yousef went way beyond  what we could have expected and was  so generous with his time and help.  I must also mention the General Manager, Tarek Allam, who was very helpful too, genuinely concerned and also extending a complimentary room extension because of my \"fragile\" condition. We were not treated as customers but as very welcome guests.  Finally I felt quite emotional as we left to board our taxi to the airport that both Mr Yousef and Mr Allam, busy people that they were, had taken the trouble to find out our departure time and were at the reception to give us a genuine hug as we left. Thank you to the staff at a truly outstanding hotel.",

      "text": "This was our fifth stay at this classic understated hotel. It’s not trying to be ultra modern or trendy , no foam parties here. Just excellent service and quality. That is its appeal. The activities are fun and in keeping with the range of clients. A particular shout out to the resident tailor Eshak. I asked him to make me a smart simple work dress. Made to measure, excellent fabric and fully lined all in three days. Fantastic quality and value. You must go see him. Take a similar garment with you if you can.",
