      "text": "What a holiday!! Best of all: the weather was warmer than usually in November as we had from 25-30 degrees. The welcome we got was excellent, we felt so welcome and immediately at ease. All staff was helpful, nice and friendly. The treatment was personal and warm, many always recognised us. The variety offered is huge, from relax and calm places (even one silent beach) to fun and sporty activities (even in low season there was still some animation and the water sports were awesome).\nWe had the all inclusive formula which was really affordable and fully worth it, we never felt reluctant to take food and were always well treated. \nSome things could be improved though:\nIt was often unclear until which time which bar would be open, f.ex. the Kirpy bar was open until 7 pm acording to our paper and the Manzara bar's information, but when we arrived at 5.55 for cocktails we were told that they were soon going to close. The Manzara took the extra mile though afterwards to prepare another cokctail without any cards for me. Timetables were not the same everywhere. Or on the document I was given, the Lagune Lounge Bar was on the all inclusive formula, when I ordered there, he told me it was not included (I only took the tea they gave me and sat down with my son, they then offered him a drink nonetheless). This was a little bit confusing but nothing more than that, not really a big deal in itself. They also had their special 100 year celebration of the nation while we were there, and I understand that it was a little bit chaotic. However we could nowhere get any reliabale information on where to eat that day and almost were sent to a place much further away that turned out to be closed just before we headed off to it. Something I would suggest is to always indicate on the buffets what it is. This was mostly the case but sometimes not and would have been interesting to know to discover more about the delicious food. Indeed, all we ate was very good and I loved the variety of foods offered. ",

There are many restaurants, however with different prices and quality. E.g. we had excellent fish and starters at the restaurant down at the beach just next to the water sports facility, whereas the food at the Laguna Lounge (located on the hotel side; silent bay) was way overpriced and quality was mediocre.
