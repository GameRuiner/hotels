      "text": "Another beautiful trip to our favourite place in Sharm. You cannot fault this hotel. The location is perfect, especially for some of the best snorkeling in Sharm. The restaurants are all incredible, with a vast selection of dishes, especially the Maharaja A la Carte where we had one of the best meals we have ever had and were looked after incredibly well by Mohamhed who couldn't do enough for us. The staff at all of the pool bars are very attentive and cater to your every need. A special mention for Ahmed and Gamal in the main Piazza Bar who looked after us for the week we were there making sure we were never without refreshments, and also to Mr. Mahmoud who is always walking around and checking in with guests to make sure they have everything they might want or need. This was our third stay at Reef and each one is better than the last, we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Sharm.",

      "text": "The name of the hotel corresponds exactly. An amazing coral reef, an oasis of well-being in a well-kept garden with pools, bars, ..., a sandy beach.\nLast year we visited this hotel twice and on Saturday we fly again, this time for the twelfth time. Everything was great as usual. Here I must remind again the great staff of the hotel, I will mention at least Mr. Nabil and his colleagues in the restaurant. Also, Mr. Beshoy makes the best cocktails in the pub and sports bar. Unfortunately, I cannot name all the hotel employees here, but they are the biggest asset of the hotel and thanks to them, the stay at this hotel is the best. We are already looking forward to next week.\nThe only thing that is a bit of a problem now is to get from our country (Czech Republic) simply by direct flight to Sharm el Sheikh. Nothing flies directly from the Czech Republic. Two years ago we flew twice with Enter Air from Katowice (Poland), and last year twice with Wizzair from Vienna (Austria). We will now fly with Wizzair from Budapest (Hungary) but after all that is already quite far for us.. I hope we can find some flight option for our next stays at Reef Oasis Beach as well.",
