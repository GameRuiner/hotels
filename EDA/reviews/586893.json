      "text": "We stayed at Dive Inn for 10 nights mid March. I travelled with my brother, there were families, groups of friends, couples and solo travellers. We found everyone to be friendly and approachable, including staff. \n\nThe pool area is lovely. There are enough sunbeds for this time of year, activities on throughout the day if you want to get involved. Pool towels are available everyday by the pool. \n\nFood is general all inclusive options that you would get anywhere. Food usually lukewarm. The main restaurant was being renovated when we visited so we were using the smaller area which could get busy but within 30 mins you could get a table. \n\nRooms are run down, wear and tear and would benefit from some touch ups, especially the bathroom. However, kept clean each day. \n\nAnimation team on from around 10am- 10pm with some breaks. Activities throughout the day and in the evenings. A little unstructured but enjoyable if you’re someone who likes to get involved. \n\nThere is a trip rep in the reception, we did the Quad biking which was fun. There is also a shuttle bus to Soho Square each night, arranged by the Animation Team and they also take guests to Discos at 11pm however there is a cost. \n\nMassage guy who comes around the pool, massages are all very cheap. \n\nHotel Taxi will ask you regularly about going out anywhere. We paid around £15 for a return trip to Soho Square however other guests advised there is an App, In Drive, which is significantly cheaper- it’s similar to Uber. \n\nOverall a lovely hotel, especially for the price you pay. To me this is a good budget / lower priced hotel.",
