      "text": "We had a very relaxing Family stay at Taj Exotica Dubai. We have choosen an upgrade to have a sea view and I would definitely recommend it. The Dinner Barbecue was perfect and our cook Sunil R. prepared us delicious King Prawns. Service was top notch! They cleaned our room 2-3 x a day. At each pool are at least 2-3 Lifeguards. The parking service was quick so there is no stress to think about where to park, just hand over the keys and relax. The breakfast was very big with a wide selection of different meals. We also played mini golf and Padel Tenis. Padel Tenis is an extra charge of 120AED for one hour which is also an OK price. \n\nWe were very satisfied and the kids want to come back, too.",

The hotel gave us a very warm welcome and accommodated all of our needs, including allowing us to check in at 9am. The food was incredible, especially the fine dining Indian cuisine, which can be sent to your room. I found the service at this hotel to be unparalleled, with a special thanks to Vikas and the concierge team, who went out of their way to ensure my wife and I enjoyed everything Dubai had to offer.",

Breakfast was top notch with variety, whilst a la carte options at the other restaurants on site were good - particularly Verq and Raya. If the children’s menus had more variety - I.e. ability to choose off main menus rather than exclusively off children’s menu - that would be great.\nStaff were all universally friendly and welcoming. \nGym was good with top quality equipment.\nRooms were very well kept,  spacious and very comfortable.\nNice to be away from all the hustle and bustle but easily commutable to the other areas/sites of interest.\nThank you to all at The Taj.",

This time... where to start...\n\nManagers not accountable for actions!! Spoke to 5 different managers in 1 week. And all had to be chased for an outcome! \n\nRuined my Louis Vuitton purchase because they couldn't follow simple instructions in concierge like leave my purchase on the bed. Instead it was left at the door, so when you open the door you literally fall over the bags, and damaged! No accountability was taken at all for the damage. \n\nStaff not aware on how to pour champagne! If you can't pour why are you working at the bar or restaurant? \n\nTables were not cleaned after the last family left and we were made to sit and eat our food there. On complaint nothing was done! \n\nMy daughters night clothing went missing and they were unable to locate it for over 36 hours! Again upon persistence they were finally located! \n\nUpon request for breakfast I requested that they wash out the egg pan as we were vegetarian and the previous customer had bacon cooked in it. This request was ignored totally and our food cooked in the same pan! So my eggs actually  had bacon it it' which i wasn't going to eat! It went to waste! \n\nAt the roaring rabbit restaurant, we ordered drinks first but they arrived after we had eaten our meals! Totally unacceptable! \n\nBased on all of this Aditya the night manager had given us access to the Taj Lounge for our final day. Upon arrival at the Taj Lounge we were told we didn't have access. Upon complaining again and explaining who had given us access, Palak the senior manager accused us of lying saying this access was never given but she was not present when Aditya had confirmed this so how would she know? After requesting her to call Aditiya to check it was confirmed we were telling the truth! No apology as yet from management for this accusation either!",
