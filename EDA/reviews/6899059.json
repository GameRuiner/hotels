The room was clean but it was very small, and a bit dark, the was a window but all we sae is another wall. Lounge zone is very cool and bartender is super proffesional, the coctails here are amazing. \nThe beds were very good, but the room has lack of space, to put clothes and wet towels was a problem. The toilet in room didn't look like private place. We were not lucky to have shower with stacionary showerhead, as for 3years old child mother it was very problematic to take a shower for kid. Breakfast was every day the same",
