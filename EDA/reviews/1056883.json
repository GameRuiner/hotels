It is not central but we enjoyed the location, there were lots of places to eat on Rambla del Poblenou which was just a short walk away (we recommend Zozan Restaurant), the beach was only about a 10 minute walk and many other sights were only 2 to 3km away. We walked to the hop on hop off bus stop and used that as transportation to other areas in the city. I would stay here again if I were to go back to Barcelona.",

      "text": "We booked a room for 10 days from booking.com for this hotel, there was no other option but non- refundable, We had a problem on our way to this accommodation. It was related to the passport expiration date. Our children's passports' expiration date was a little less then 3 months. (We didn't know about 3 months terms!) We had applied to get new passports for our kids more then 1 month ago. But these new passports are produced in Ukraine and we still couldn't get them.  Our flight tickets were also canceled, and we have got a refund for the flight we couldn't take. (Which was also non-refundable). There is no such thing as non-refundable, a company can make a penalty cut, but still you get some money back for services which you were not able to use. We are in Turkey now and very upset. Our vacation was ruined. We notified the facility and canceled the reservation as soon as possible. However,  we suggested a partly money refund or another option for those days when we are not able to receive accommodation + breakfast, service. We are planning to go to Barcelona in April. We expect to have new passports ready in March.  We wanted to postpone our stay in this hotel, but the hotel's management didn't agree. The hotel refused all other options. We spoke with Miss Carma, and she didn't offer any help. Do you consider it as good customer service? We would never again use any of the facilities of Holiday Inn. \nAs you can see we have been to a lot of different hotels in different locations, so if I say Holiday Inn is not worth it you may believe me",

Personal attention could go a long way.\n\nThe room was decent and clean, but the bathroom was a tad old and needed a refresh.
