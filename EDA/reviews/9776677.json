      "text": "We arrived at the Hotel at Midnight (as conveyed to the Hotel) and our room was not ready.  We waited over an hour (We believe they may have given our room away and were now trying to get something ready for us).\nThe room was not clean! Carpets were dirty, the bathroom was not cleaned properly. There was only one towel (no floor mat & no hand towel).\nWe were so tired, and thankfully, the bed was clean and quite comfortable, we just went to bed.\nIn the morning they brought us another 1 towel, after we told them there was only the 1 towel in our room. They made a poor attempt at cleaning the bathroom and left.\nThe bathroom had mould, grout falling out, dirty floors, old doors that are not in good shape.\nThe foyer has been spruced up a little, but at closer look you can see that they are not maintaining the Hotel very well.\nNow I should explain that we have travelled extensively, and have stayed in old Hotels before, however, they were always extremely clean and obviously better maintained than this Hotel.\nThe staff were very nice. That's about the only positive thing I can say about the place, other than it's in a good spot, only a 20min walk to the Gold and Spice Souks. In the old part of town.\nI would not recommend staying here if cleanliness is a priority for you.\n",
