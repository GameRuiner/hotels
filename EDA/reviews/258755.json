Neither heat nor cooling was available in the rooms and if we knew this we would not have booked it. Staff stated they don’t know what’s on the website but that’s the way it is and too bad. They changed our room so we would have a door to allow additional air flow into the room but this doesn’t remove the misleading/false advertising. Also, the pool was under renovation (we would not have used anyway but again, this wasn’t communicated to us, not even during check in) but it’s tiny for a hotel of this size.",

The best part about the hotel is its location! We would stay in this location again hands down.\n\nCons: SO LOUD!! Our room faced an alley that was extremely loud, even with the window closed. Our neighbour might as well have joined us in our room as we could hear his entire phone conversation through the very thin walls. Additionally, despite being far from the elevator, every time someone took it, we could hear squeaking and squealing in our room (sounded like someone was dragging furniture in the room above - strange how sound travels!). Other small things to note: no fan in bathroom, glass bathroom door (hello, lack of privacy), and only one chair (easily room for 2). Also, the shower drained very slowly and water got everywhere.\n\nWe can’t speak to the breakfast as we didn’t purchase (it was cheaper to get food elsewhere). We were allowed to check in early, but did notify the hotel in advance.",

      "text": "Met or exceeded all of my expectations.  Breakfast buffet has a very good selection of hot, room temperature and cold foods, juices and a coffee machine that dispenses very hot water from a separate nozzle for tea. I detest the taste of coffee so this was a big bonus for me.  Having said that there are two cafes roughly two hundred meters away if you want something small for breakfast at half of the buffet cost. We had a double bed that was two twin mattresses. One mattress was medium and the other was medium-firm. We couldn't figure out the air conditioning unit settings for the room to blow anything other than warm air so we opened the window that first night and slept well enough that we didn't bother to report it to the front desk. No mosquitos or bugs found us on the sixth floor in February.  And we always travel with sleep masks and earplugs.",
