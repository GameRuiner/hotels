      "text": "A wonderful city hotel unfortunately let down by the worst service I have experienced in a five star hotel.\nI can’t remember ever being somewhere so disorganized.  I attended the hotel for a conference, and upon arrival put my shirts in for laundry selecting the six hour option.  They came 24 hours later and only after I had to call three times and chase them down.  I therefore missed one morning of my conference.  Next up, I ordered room service before going to an important meeting.  They said 30 minutes.  I started chasing at 30 minutes and they kept telling me ‘two minutes’.  This went on for another 40 minutes, now 70 minutes after I ordered before I had to leave for my meeting having not eaten.  All in all just not good enough.  The general air is of a place where there is little discipline amongst the staff.  A shame, because the room and bathroom were beautiful.",

      "text": "Upon arrival no normal warm St.Regis greetings , no welcome drink or cold towel not even a thank you for being a loyal member , basically a bunch of irritated looking staff members (possibly because they dont like living in dubai im not sure) anyhow i booked a Deluxe Suite which was just a large room , although the room is beautiful and well decorated the views were terrible and room has alot of street noise as well. 9/10 stays with Bonvoy im offered an upgrade here i was not which is fine. \n\nBreakfast is mediocre and i never even met my butler or had a welcome note or gift in my room , the best staff here are the door men and bell boys very nice and friendly, front desk staff and restaurant staff not so much big lack of training and customer service . For the price your paying Dubai has way more options from bonvoy available which will definitely appreciate your loyalty. I had come from Abu Dhabi St.regis before this stay and had an amazing warm stay which probably made this one seem even worse ,will not be back here again do not recommend it especially to gold or platinum members. \n\nNote that the location is excellent and the hotel is very well renovated and decorated which is such a shame considering the service provided.",
