The breakfast was exceptional as was the lunch and the waiter even made something to cater for our diet requirements. Thank you for looking after us! I. Terms of practicality the hotel is opposite a beach with lots of attractions nearby, but the pool is smaller compared to a resort. The rooms are huge and very nice well kept and very clean. ",

(Try and visit when the cruise ships are not in) The hotel has a fairly small swimming pool with limited sun beds. However the beach is across the road. Non swimmers should be aware that there is a steep gradient and the pebble nature makes access without sea shoes difficult.\nThe hotel rooms are very well appointed with every accessory except a kettle. There was a pod making coffee machine at an extra charge.\nThe food was varied and of good quality with the exception of the orange juice which was just coloured water. \nThe staff were all very friendly and I would stay at the hotel again without hesitation.",

      "text": "We booked 2 rooms this hotel via our agency. When we arrived, it was discovered that one of our rooms was booked with incorrect dates. \nThe receptionist who was in contact with the head managers assure that there is no room available, all is fully booked. \nWe contacted our agency and surprisingly, they were able to book a room in the hotel online. Thanks to then we got a place to stay with all our family. \nAs soon as the hotel managers see that we got a room, they offered us to cancel the online booking and to book it with them (although 5 min before they had no available room). Then we overpay to the hotel, they sold to us a sea view room, although our first booking was a sea front as you can see from the vouchers. \nWhy do I attached the vouchers, because when we tell this to the hotel manager, she pretend to do not understand what we talk about. Perhaps she got problems with memory so we remind her all of this, and even she is forgetting to return the sum according to the contract. \nBUT THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY: we have learned from our agency that the manager, who do not understand what we talk about, did not agree to return even the part of the sum paid for the wrong booking which is called no show. They did not inform the agency about no show and normal hotels are fully understanding such situations, and do not charge for such mistakes. However, at list they should have returned the sum according to the contract notes in the voucher, 22% of the paid sum, which is about 500 Euros.  \nSo, CORRUPTION in the HEART OF THE BEAUTIFUL RHODES CITY. THE CITY AND OUR STAY  IS SPOILED BY SUCH MONEY SEEKERS. \nAND they are treating the hotel staff with the same philosophy: to get the last cent from the pocket of the guest. \nAs you see, the hotel is loosing its rating day by day, so the new management is making from the MEDITERRANEAN HOTEL a MEDITERRANEAN HELL.",

In your presence we contacted your agent who admitted that it was a mistake instead of June you wanted to come in July. \nWe accommodated you to our best even though the hotel was fully booked and of course we expalined to you that you should contact your agent to be reimbursed since as you declared it was hsi smistake on the dates of your booking. \nWe do trust and understand your frustation but we kindly ask you to recall all the incidents and admit that the hotel acted professionally and even though you had no reservation in July we saw the despair on  your face and accommodated to our best of our hospitality.
