Staff were helpful & attentive, the gorgeous room was impeccably clean and beautifully presented, and they excelled in personal touches that make a visit so special. From a beautiful bunch of flowers for my birthday, to Easter treats on the weekend, to arranging a Doctor visit for my husband the staff are second to none. Perfectly located with an abundance of shops & amazing restaurants in walking distance, as well as a taxi rank and metro stop outside the door. We highly recommend this beautiful property!",
