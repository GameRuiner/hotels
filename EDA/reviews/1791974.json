      "text": "This is a lovely family run hotel, admittedly it is not in the best area but it is perfect for accessing all the touristic spots available in ƒ∞zmir. 10 minute walk to the seafront, 5 minutes to the kulturpark and Luna park. Other sightseeing stuff close by too. The hotel offers a good breakfast,tea,coffee,juice and a traditional Turkish breakfast in a cute little dining area. All the staff are lovely especially the hotel cat! üòç Not the best soundproofed rooms but if you are a heavy sleeper like me it won't be a problem. We saw a few different rooms and they were all lovely, plenty of space for suitcases or bags. The other hotels we looked at in the area were disgraceful but this one, for the star rating and cost is absolutely perfect for a few days stay. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, my husband is actually going back here in a couple of weeks to attend an exam in ƒ∞zmir. Rooms spacious, breakfast very good, cleanliness good, staff lovely, the cat gorgeous. ",

      "text": "My wife and I stayed here as part of a trip to Turkey in August/September 2023.\n\nThere are a lot of things to like about this hotel, unfortunately it is brought down by a few major things that mean that we will likely not be coming back here.\n\nLets start positive:\n- The location: Very close to Basmane Train station (excellent if you want to take the train to Ephesus or Pamukkale) and close to the bazar and agora. The restaurants nearby are pretty good, authentic, and very cheap. For my wife and I, this was perfect.\n- Service: The hotel staff, when we interacted with them, were friendly and helpful.\n- The room. Quite spacious with plenty of storage. The bathroom was also perfectly serviceable (though the wall sized mirror was a little strange).\n\nWe also stayed on the fourth floor and this hotel has no elevator. Not a problem for us, but some people may have an issue with this.\n\nHowever, I have some issues:\n- The bedding: possibly some of the worst bedding I have ever had to deal with at a hotel. The sheets had holes in them, and the primary blanket wasn't big enough for the bed. Furthermore the secondary blanket, which we had to use because the primary one wasn't good enough, was one of the ITCHIEST blankets I have ever used. I don't think we got a proper nights sleep because of this.\n- The breakfast: It isn't included and overpriced. \n- No water: This is more of a gripe I have with Turkish hotels in general, rather than this one inn particular, but in most other countries that I have been to where the water wasn't safe to drink, the hotel would provide us with complimentary bottles of water. Turkish hotels did not. Come on! The bottles are not that expensive and is 35C outside! Give your guests at least some water!!!\n\nI think this hotel could be a great place for people like us to stay, if they just fixed those above issues, and they don't seem that hard to fix to me.",
