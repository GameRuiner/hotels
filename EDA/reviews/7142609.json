      "text": "Serras Barcelona is an exceptional hotel, in large part because of the fabulous staff.  Everyone was so welcoming and helpful, but the best was Sandra the breakfast manager.  She made me and my two children feel at home from day one.  From learning our names immediately, having our drink orders ready the minute we sat down to  checking to see if my kids slept okay, she was amazing.  Made us feel at home away from home.  My son already made me promise that we would go back to visit her in a few years!",

      "text": "We were generously upgraded to the Junior Suite by booking through our agent, but even the suite was only 40sqm and was a little tight. The room itself is very four stars. There was no welcome amenity as described in our booking, but instead there was a small cake. Service overall was very good, food, we thought was excellent, but a bit salty. We were told they were meant to be salty traditionally. \n\nBreakfast was basic and there’s an additional 16 euro charge for an avocado toast. \n\nThe location is charming but nowhere near designer stores. The reason I can’t give five stars is because it was not cheap and at that price, I expected perfection. The housekeeping kept forgetting to replenish various things throughout our 4 night stay. Maybe they can implement a checklist system to ensure we don’t have to keep asking for basic things like toilet paper, cotton buds, etc. \n\nOverall, it was okay but given the price point, I don’t think I’d stay here again.",

I’ve stayed at many luxury properties and none have come close.  While the team truly stood out helping through a difficult situation with a flight cancellation (and went beyond any expectations), the team was wonderful throughout the stay and made for a fabulous stay. Food also is terrific.  It should be a first choice in Barcelona.",
