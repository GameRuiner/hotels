      "text": "The best hotel I've ever stayed in: I'm not sure how it does not have 5 stars. Everything about Hotel Colon is perfect: The location cannot be beat. It is in the heart of so much activity: shops, bars, restaurants, street performers, shows, and tours. The hotel itself is gorgeous. It has a beautiful lobby, tastefully appointed with the best staff. They are professional, kind, and happy to assist. Raquel at the front desk, the gentleman a the hotel door, the staff at breakfast, and the cleaning staff are all amazing at their jobs. My parents and I stayed in a triple, with a big bed for them and a very comfortable cot for me. We each had our own wardrobe to hang our clothes, and there was plenty of room to walk around. The bathroom was beautiful, with a wonderful hot shower and stocked with amenities. At night in an alleyway near the cathedral a very good looking and extremely talented gentleman sings opera. For free! This is a magical city.",

      "text": "The hotel is ideally situated, right in the middle of the Gothic Quarter - with easy access to everything - I really loved the location. The hotel is beautiful, with a wonderful restaurant, and fantastic breakfast. We visited the rooftop bar for a few minutes upon arrival, but we didn't feel the need to stay long because the view from our Juliet balcony in our room was just as amazing as the view from the rooftop. Our hotel room was on the 5th floor, cathedral view design room with king bed. The bed was so comfortable, and our room was a great size. Very clean, with lots of little extras and thoughtful touches. \n\nHowever, the bare walls in our room created a look and feel that was too sterile. Similarly to other reviewers, i found it a little challenging to balance the room temperature at night while also needing to keep the windows / doors closed due to street noise. But overall it was not a big deal for me. I will always choose a great view over a super quiet room. I just used a 'white noise' app on my phone at bedtime. The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. \n\nThe only thing I really, REALLY didn't like was being scrutinized / questioned by the door staff upon entering the hotel whenever there was a line / queue outside the hotel for the rooftop bar... the bar is open to the public and there is a big demand, so people line up to gain access to the bar. Every time my daughter and I would return to the hotel after being out - we would be questioned about why we were entering and where we were going. Even upon saying I was a guest at the hotel, on several occasions the doorman just looked me up and down questioningly. I hated it. NOT a nice feeling upon entering the hotel you're staying in. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, and the complimentary car service to the airport upon our departure was a very nice touch, and much appreciated!!!",

      "text": "First time in Europe ever, touchdown Barcelona. \n\nHotel Col√≥n set the bar high as far as first impressions of a city replete with gothic architecture, savory tapas, and rhythmic flamenco. What led me to book this hotel over others was its prime location -- in the heart of Gothic Quarter and right in front of the Catedral de Barcelona, which was awe-inspiring every time I stepped foot outside.\n\nNo need to book the room with the view either. As other reviewers have stated, there is an quintessential rooftop terrace bar which provides a beautiful view of the cathedral. Wait for an unhindered table and enjoy that instagrammable view. Worth it for a few drinks, not necessarily for the food. \n\nHowever, the hotel breakfast buffet served downstairs is the BEST! Out of all the hotel breakfasts we encountered on our Euro trip, Hotel Col√≥n had the number one spread -- a vast selection of meats, cheeses, sandwiches, fruits, yogurt, salad, and hot foods such as empanadas and sausages, complete with fresh juices and espressos. And a mimosa bar, too? Yes.\n\nAs for the room, it's clean and modern. Surprisingly spacious with a seating nook. Rain shower in the bathroom and great water pressure. Double twin bed comfortable. \n\nThe employees were all so attentive and friendly. We went in February, so I forgot all the names now, but the doormen always greeted you, helped with luggage, and even took us to the airport (this amenity is not standard, it depends on availability). Overall, excellent stay. Thank you!",
