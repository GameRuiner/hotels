The experience has always been excellent from the  meet and greet from the plane; the room; the service and food quality in the restaurant. There are many members of staff we would commend on making our stay perfect, to name a few Senthill, Abdul, Nilan and the chef whom we donâ€™t often see Umesh. They go the extra professional mile in making the stay very positive. \nIt is an added cost to the journey so it can be expensive  but we enjoy the experience and feel refreshed after our stay.",
