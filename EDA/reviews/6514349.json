      "text": "Zeniva hotel\nLocated in the centre of Izmir at K√ºlt√ºr, Kƒ±zƒ±lay Cd. No:1, 35220 Konak/ƒ∞zmir, T√ºrkiye. The hotel was recommended by an employee who staid here before.  The entry is modern and they have vale parking what is great because parking is a drama in the old city centers. Reception person was fast and effective with the checking in. And we were guided to our room fast.  The room was exactly as on the photo.  Perfect decorated and excellent for a small family as ours.  The bathroom is modern and has this giant shower head that is really relaxing. We had booked the ‚Äúsuit‚Äù.  The night is good and quiet although we are in the inner city.  In the morning the hotel service a breakfast what is excellent and there is enough to fill up the stomach for the rest of the day.  We don‚Äôt know if they serve more because around the hotel there are plenty of restaurants to go to and have a dinner.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone business or short family trip.  The people who want a swimming pool in the hotel need to book somewhere else.  We didn‚Äôt mind for this trip. Small side note üóíÔ∏è it‚Äôs a pity that Turkish people do not obey the rules for smoking üö¨ the room had a small sigaret smell what is logic because nicotine and sigaret smell is very difficult to get out of the rooms.  Sorry for the hotel management on this point it‚Äôs not their fault. \nEnjoy and have a blast in Izmir centre plenty things to see and do within walking distance from the hotel.",
