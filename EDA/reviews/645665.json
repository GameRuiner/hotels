      "text": "After numerous trips to Egypt, we were delighted to return to Sharm El Sheikh. Choosing this Dreams Vacations Resort hotel was a real hit. We were immediately impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of all the staff. Built in the Hispano-Moorish style near the Old Market in Sharm and The Heavenly Cathedral  and Al Mustafa Mosque, it is in an excellent location dotted with gardens leading to the beautiful beach of the Red Sea. Dreams Vacations Resort and its sister hotel Dreams Beach Resort make an ideal hotel for a relaxing vacation. We were delighted with the relaxing atmosphere in the entire part of the hotel, such as the lobby, around the pool and the beach. The beach is a special jewel of the hotel carved into the rock. Going down the stairs to the beach is a bit steep, but that's why there is an elevator that takes us to the beautiful beach, which is full of gorgeous coral reefs, which makes the underwater animal life fascinating. Schools of fish of vivid colors, shapes and sizes swim completely relaxed around us and are not afraid at all. The beauty of the atmosphere and silence that we experienced diving in the sea, in the luxurious environment of corals, is more than impressive. The hotel has 5 swimming pools and a spa. We were most satisfied with the service of the hotel staff, their exceptional kindness delighted us. From the reception, the organization of excursions, the restaurant (extremely friendly and professional waiters, congratulations), the party by the pool and on the beach as well as in the evening, the whole team delighted us. The hotel offer is rich and diverse. Reception with a nice lobby bar, 3 in-house restaurants including a Mexican restaurant and a buffet restaurant with an outdoor terrace, (variety of extremely delicious food, Egyptian, oriental and Mediterranean, a large selection for all palates delighted us, all praise to the chefs), fitness, congress center, market, souvenir shop, night club, laundry, possibility to rent a car, wireless internet at the reception (no extra charge), entertainment. The hotel is air-conditioned. Umbrellas, sunbeds and mattresses (no extra charge, depending on availability), beach or pool towels are free of charge. On the entire area of the pool and the beach, all-inclusive drinks and food service, which delighted us. The rooms are nicely decorated, they are a bit retro, but that does not diminish the wonderful atmosphere of the stay. We felt good and had a good time. Thanks for everything.",

      "text": "So I want to give an honest review of our holiday.  We love the place and would be very keen to come back. My husband and I wanted a relaxing holiday to lie by a pool and not do much else and that's exactly what you can do.\nIf you are looking for a holiday with a British style breakfast, lots of entertainment and lots of English speakers, this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for somewhere, that's interesting with wonderful staff who go out of their way to make the customer happy with beautiful scenery, hot hot weather,  Lovely pools and nice food come here!\nWe had some of the best hospitality I have ever experienced, especially from Ayman the restaurant manager.\nIn the evenings that are many local places that are worth visiting, especially Soho Square in our opinion.\nThe only downside I would say is the lack of entertainment on site. Sometimes it would be nice to watch a full show rather than the 20 minutes they seem to do. I was also very on keen on the drinks. Hubby was fine. Drinking beer but the juice is very very sweet and I didn't like any of the local alcohols.",

      "text": "My birthday treat was to go on holiday with two close girlfriends, and knowing many hotels in sharm including Dreams Vacation and Dreams Beach, we opted on Dreams Vacation. \nThis hotel is owned by 3 brothers and managed by an owner representative, but a network of the superb, long serving management team are what keeps these two hotels afloat. \nDreams beach has undergone some rooms renovation making it light, bright and fresh. \nDreams Vacation rooms are however dated and tired with renovation needed. \nThe Egyptian government recently invested massively in sharm, and the owners would benefit in the long run if they did the same to Dreams Vacation. \nHowever, aside from this statement I want to express thanks to so many staff who made our holiday an amazing, fun experience. \nThe food in Vacation was tasty with fair presentation. The restaurant manager Aymen, was without a doubt the icing on the cake for this hotel, his natural ability to juggle his team so well and still remain so attentive to his guests was outstanding. His team Lov him, as do his guests, and he is a credit to the hotel. \nThe housekeeping team are happy, smiling, polite and underpaid… but despite this their efforts to keep you smiling when you return to your room to find towel decorations and flower petals can only be applauded with thanks… and of course the well deserved gratuities that we all appreciate in life. \nThe front office team, and the bars reception team are always smiling, helpful and willing to go above and beyond. The bell captain manager Amouda and his team both in vacation and in Beach are polite, happy and above all conduct their work in a professional and organised routine, and are all happy to help with many situations, not only luggage. \nResident mgr Mr Ahmed and rooms division Mr Essam are two of the kindest, caring individuals I’ve had the pleasure of meeting, approachable and extremely caring when it comes to Dreams hotel resorts. (Special thanks for teaching us Towla to front office mgr Hossam)\nA big well done to animation Mgr Sherif and his team for fun pool foam parties, aerobics and music, with great evening entertainment at both beach and vacation. \n\nI will be back soon… xx\n",
