      "text": "This hotel is an elegant step back in time with all the modern amenities. We booked a junior suite which had ample space to unpack and relax and the bedding is sublime. The rooftop bar/pool is a must with breathtaking views of the Cathedral, Sangrada Familia, mountains, and harbor and, their croquettes and patatas bravas are some of the best we have had.  The concierge was extremely helpful booking a last minute tour and not only providing restaurant recommendations but making our reservations.  If you happen to be there Thur-Sat and enjoy live music and high end cocktails, make a reservation for the Speakeasy located below the lobby.  It was the perfect end to our week in Barcelona.",

As some have said, the inner courtyard view is nothing to write home about, but it didn't matter because the room was amazing and above all else...the service was exceptional. The friendliness of all the hotel staff and their willingness to help with anything was very much appreciated. The lobby is beautiful and relaxing. We didn't have a chance to really enjoy the rooftop because the weather was cold and wet, but the views from there are amazing. The layout was also very inviting.",

For example, there is a nice breakfast buffet, but if you want to order fresh cooked eggs or an omelet there is a “surcharge.”  They give you two complementary bottles of water each day, but if you ask for any additional water they charge you.  Other than that, the hotel is beautiful, the room was very comfortable, the staff was great and the location is perfect.  Would stay there again in a minute.",
