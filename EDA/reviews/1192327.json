      "text": "The usual search for a hotel via Tripadvisor bought us to decide on this property.  At a cost of around £210 per night for our three night stay it was a little on the expensive side but we felt we got a pretty decent deal.\n\nA pretty large bedroom/living area with both being more than comfortable and gave us a good nights sleep in the Queen Bed.  This 'Deluxe Studio' with a small kitchenette area with a microwave, fridge and toaster.  The Bathroom was also clean and had everything you would need.\n\nAll in all a great stay in a fantastic city, a little on the pricey side but the room itself was faultless.",

      "text": "Great apartment to stay with a family. We had a separate room, so more than enough room for all our luggage, etc. The room was clean and serviced every 3 days. But the best thing I liked was that I could do the families washing! (we had been travelling for a while and have an 8 yr old who can't seem to keep clothes clean :) ) Staff were super friendly also.\nThe only down point was the location, this hotel is (I think) in the financial distract so that there isn't really a lot going on around this area for first time travellers to Barcelona. The area is safe though. The beach is about a 30min walk away and about the same time to the city centre/La Rambla. The train station, Marina, is the closet and around about a 5min walk",

Just let us point out that the district is not a financial one but a mix of residential and renovated area since the Olympics took place in Barcelona.

No pool, no daily house keeping, no water in the room, no individual toiletries (large dispensers bolted to the wall as per 3 star Premier Inns). Staff were nice. The 210€ rate didn’t include breakfast - another reasonable 15€. Room was very large with microwave and small kitchen. Bed and pillows could have been more comfortable. Shower pressure was ok but no thermostat on the shower mixer so variable temperature. And why do I have to clean the shower head? There was a desk for working but no power outlets nearby for laptops. Had to remove light plug to recharge my phone and iPad. Only stayed 2 nights for work. Really didn’t feel it met the quality I’d expect for the rating and price. This isn’t the center of Barcelona.",

They are our most valued asset, and your recognition means a lot to us.\n\nIn regard to the swimming pool, we understand the confusion, but it is important to note that we do not have a swimming pool on the premises, a detail that we communicate clearly in all our booking confirmations. Similarly, our cleaning service is scheduled every three days during a guest's stay to provide a balance between comfort and sustainability.\n\nOur choice of Simmons brand beds and pillows reflects our commitment to offering quality and comfortable accommodations. However, we understand that personal preferences can vary when it comes to comfort, and we appreciate your understanding.\n\nWe regret that you were not aware of the laptop plug near the desk during your stay. Please do not hesitate to let us know of any specific requirements in the future, and we will do our utmost to ensure your needs are met.\n\nRegarding our location, we are indeed conveniently located just three metro stops away from Catalunya Square. While we may not be in the heart of the city center, we believe our proximity to major attractions offers a balance between accessibility and tranquility that many of our guests appreciate.\n\nOnce again, thank you for choosing our establishment for your stay. Your feedback is valuable to us as we continually strive to enhance our guest experience. If you have any further comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to share them. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMarc Camps\nGM",
