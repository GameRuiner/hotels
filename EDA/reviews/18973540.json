      "text": "Family room is perfect (2 adults and 2 children) with 1 double bed and 2 single beds. Beds are soft and comfortable, bathroom is big, shower is really good (shower system with shower column) and breakfast is nice. The view is magnificent and pool is fine. The beach is ok, but bring swimming shoes as there is sea ​​urchins at the bottom - however there is also lots of fish to look at, so bring snorkeling gear as well. \nStaff is friendly and kind - and not at all pushy or anything. \nIt seems as the small details has been thought through. \nI recommend the hotel to everyone that wants a peaceful and beautiful place to take a break from the everyday life. \n\nNotes: not suitable for disabled persons with wheelchair or mobility issues. \n\nP.S. \nYou will find the two most beautiful beaches (Ilıca and Altınkum) located about 20 minute’s drive away. \nÇeşme centrum is 10 minutes drive and 20 minutes to Alaçatı. Both cities are beautiful and authentic, but also tourists attractions. ",

      "text": "It's a long story...  Checked into hotel and it's on a main road.  The reception is small and dingy with an adjoining public sitting area that seams to have staff/family members sat in it.  These are mainly men so it was quite intimidating for single women.  The garden rooms we booked were close to the road and a bit smelly.  They moved us to seaview rooms which were lovely but in the night, all the noise from the public areas was over our heads in our two separate rooms.  Footsteps, shouting, moving furniture until the early hours.  We got no sleep.  The bar had no wine which is all I drink and very little other choice.  Same for the restaurant but they order some of the menu items from a restaurant in town some miles away.  There is little English spoken which isn't a problem if things are going well.  We were so distraught after our first night getting little or no sleep we left despite not being able to claim back our 2 further nights and the hotel refused to refund them despite us complaining directly, with evidence and even contacting Expedia.  Who did nothing!  The hotel could be good if it has the facilities in full working order as advertised.  I don't believe the owners are hospitality professionals and run this without any knowledge of hospitality requirements.  I will not be looking to get a refund through my credit card.",

      "text": "just back from a week at lifepoint as everyone else has said it is in a superb location being on the edge of the sea with fabulous sunsets and a nice pool. What lets this hotel down is mismanagement ,there is virtually no cleaning going on here not in the rooms or anywhere else . The advertised bar was closed for our full week only being in use for the staff to sit behind on two evenings whilst it remained closed . We went in early september and most rooms were occupied . Customers bottles and glasses were left and not taken away all week on or behind the bar .The swimming pool area was not cleaned at all for the week this is very unusual for a turkish establishment to not care about cleanliness . Dont get me wrong the hotel is lovely just needs some care and cleaning to go on",

It is relatively new and all the staff were really helpful, even though their grasp of English was not great. That is no criticism.\nThe room was sea view overlooking the pool and ocean and gardens. It was well equipped and clean. Bathroom was excellent along with the shower. Breakfast was excellent, full Turkish!!! Nothing was to much for the waiters. \nThe location was great for getting into cesme or the surrounding area. There were numerous beaches close to the hotel but as it had a jetty at the bottom of the garden everything was at hand.\nThus was an excellent hotel and great value.",
