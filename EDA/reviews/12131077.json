As our flight was at afternoon we could left out luggages all day with the receptionist. If you are this kind of tourist who usually go back early I definitely recommend this Hotel! (We chose this one for the location, but actually it wasn't as good as we thought 'cause at night the streets are so dark and there aren't people around, but during the day is amazing because you can go by walk to the pier and the most important tourist points).",
