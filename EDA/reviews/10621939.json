      "text": "I spent there 6 nights. I got a very spacious 2-bed apartment which was cleaned every day. The building is about 10-max.15min. walk from the metro station: The Gardens. There are many shops around the building plus tons of takeaways with delicious Indian food. I need to say to the staff is top class. They are very helpful and friendly. To go to the hotel, I took an Uber from Dubai International Airport which cost me approx. 180 AED. On my way back I walked to the metro station and took a metro which cost me 7.5 AED. From the Gardens metro station to Terminal 3, it takes 1 hour by metro. It is a place where there are not many Europeans but it is safe and do not be scared. They offer great value for money.",

      "text": "As other reviews state, THIS HOTEL IS A SCAM.\n\nFirstly, they tried to charge me 200 AED for non existent stains on curtain and bed. They couldn‚Äôt provide any proof and when somebody came to the room they changed the story multiple times and added a stained sofa too despite me showing time stamped photos. When questioned if this costs 200AED to wash a bed sheet that was being accused, his reply was ‚Äúyes‚Äù\n\nLuckily they do not have access to my card to charge this anyway so can‚Äôt charge me.\n\nOn check out, (we checked out a day early) somebody had to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù our room to see if it was okay.. 5 mins after we had apparently left green / yellow stains on the towels. ANOTHER LIE. We know this because we knew we were checking out early so had everything clean and changed ready to leave, so there were actually no dirty towels left in the apartment as they were all fresh. I believe they were going to try and charge us until they realised they couldn‚Äôt. I can only believe this was now an act of racism towards us.\n\nDespite the cheekiness of the staff trying to falsely charge us. Here‚Äôs everything that‚Äôs wrong with the hotel:\n\nNot as described as on listing: - Therefore I am Entitled to claim section 75 of credit card and receive a full refund.\n1. Swimming pool - doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a 10 min walk and didn‚Äôt answer emails when I asked twice on email before arrival where I had free cancellation, It says on the listing is has direct access\n2. No balcony as shown on the photos\n3. No fire extinguisher in room as advertised\n4. It says there is separate seating area and a separate dining area. There isn‚Äôt. There is 2 dirty chairs around a small circle table next to the bed.\n5. Advertised free WiFi but can only have on 4 devices\n6. Advertises free private parking but doesn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs public parking and hard to get a space at night time. Sometimes even having to park far away from hotel with 2 small children is really not ideal.\n7. No ironing facilities or iron as advertised\n8. No video games as advertised\n9. Room that was pictured on listing we booked is not the same room we are in.\n10. No city view as stated from my room.\n11. No coffee machine as stated in ‚Äúall rooms‚Äù on booking.com\n12. No dryer as stated in ‚Äúall rooms‚Äù on booking.com\n\nBroken stuff :\n1. Cooker doesn‚Äôt cook properly - told staff about this they brushed it off.\n2. Telephone\n3. Clothes airer half broken and rusty really had\n4. Nail hanging out of floor in bathroom\n5. Plates are chipped\n6. Broken wardrobe\n7. Hot water only gets lukewarm and not hot\n8. Tap does not work and if using the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù water it isn‚Äôt strong pressure it‚Äôs very weak\n\nOther issues:\n1. Had to chase 3 times (twice in person, then over email) for the microwave, toaster and bath plug that was supposed to be here 3 days prior, they then called the doorbell after I had to email at 8:30am and woke up my children.\n2. 2 coat hangers available for a family of 4.\n3. Had to chase for plates, cups, bowls, cutlery, everything that should be in the apartment already and half are chipped anyway\n4. Only given 2 towels per day despite 4 being on booking\n5. States free toiletries but only giving one small sample bottle a day for 4 people of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. Today they didn‚Äôt even replace them.\n6. Accused of staining curtains when didn‚Äôt - Offending mark rubbed off straight away with a wet wipe. It also states in recent reviews on google there are stains and dirtiness and items not working already! So I can only believe this was an act of racism towards us as we are a white family and being wrongly accused.\n7. On check out tried to say we stained towels yellow / green\n\nDirty:\n1. Dirty walls\n2. Dirty chairs\n3. Dirty carpets\n4. Dirty microwave\n5. Really dirty bath\n6. Dirty curtains both sides\n7. Dirty cupboards inside all of them\n8. Dirty cooker all over\n9. Dirty windows\n10. Dirty window sills\n11. Clothes rack\n12. Dirty frying pan\n13. Stained mattress and sheets\n",
