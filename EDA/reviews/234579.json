      "text": "Check-in was pleasant but that was the highlight.\nThe room is really basic: no safe, no fridge, no kettle.  When I went down to Reception to ask about this I would rudely told \"Well what did you expect for a 2 star hotel\"!  For the price I was paying (it was listed as a Superior room and was not cheap, the price was on a par with other, better hotels in the area) I expect the basics and politeness but I didn't get either.   When I mentioned that the advert listed free toiletries in the room I was told that there was soap.\nGiven how bare the room was, you'd expect it to be easy to clean but there was sand on the floor when arrived.\n\nBreakfast was included but I could have paid â‚¬10 or â‚¬15 (depending on which notice in the lifts you were to believe) for it.  It was basic and the same everyday, plus not a lot of each dish put out",
