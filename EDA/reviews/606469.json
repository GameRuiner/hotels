      "text": "We chose this hotel based on price and local transport accessibility. The hotel is located in 2 adjacent building. The main (older) building is ok but the one in the back of the cafeteria has newer accomodation and a/c and heating provided by individual units which is excellent compared to the older building that has a central system that changes from summer to winter. With climate change and 30°C in november, we are able to use a/c in the new part of the hotel. The hotel has a terrasse with table and chairs just between the cafeteria and the newer building.\nThe room are standard size with one double or 2 single beds. The bathroom is small but well set. Spain being a very noisy country, I was surprised to hear very little noise from the inside and outside of the hotel. Well insulated windows.\nSome rooms have 4 beds.\nMetro Artigues (line 2) is 7 minutes away and a bus can take you about 150 mtrs from the subway just by taking an M26 or a B14 bus across the street from the hotel.\nThere is hotel cafeteria but just behind there are a very good choice of restaurants on Avinguda de Catalunya. We are still here until Nov 4th when we will board a ship. \nThe employees are all nice but being understood in English can be a challenge if you dont speak Spanish. A special thank you to Alan at reception who is always there to help.\nNevertheless they do their best to accomodate your requests.\nAlso, 2 laundromats at less than 5 minutes walking from the hotel.\n\nAll in all it is an excellent value with a lot of services in the hotel or nearby. We will certainly be back.\n",

      "text": "The value for money was not so good, the hotel has some nice public areas but it is divided into two buildings, my room wasn't in the main building (which I suspect doesn't have lift), and on the other building where my room was at, I was on the 3rd floor and the lift only reached the 2nd floor.\nThere was a balcony and the room although small was comfortable. Cleaning even though done daily, was not that efficient.\nThere were many things on the room needing to be fixed or refurbished. Particularly the shower, which I had to call out reception to fix the issue.\nThe AC worked fine as well as the TV. The bed was comfortable.\nThe hotel is situated in the north side of the city, there is a huge highway bridge next to it, it is not close to Barcelona center and opposes El Prat Airport making it a journey of almost 2 hours by bus (you have to taker two or three).\nStill, receptionists went out of their way, great employees.",

      "text": "This is perhaps a strange acknowledgement of an excelent service, as I have never visited the Hotel - yet. However, the story is, that we vere 5 friends who were going to the Formula 1 race i Barcelona from the 6/5 to the 11/5 2020. We booked rooms at the Hotel and prepaid the whole stay, with no cancelation rights. Then came the Corona crisis and the Race was postponed, the flights was not leaving and the whole trip was off. The Hotel refunded all the mony, even though they did not have to do that ! That is excelent service in my opinion ! We are looking forward to rebook the rooms once the Formula 1 race is back again. We wish this Hotel the best of luck in the future.",
