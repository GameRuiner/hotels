      "text": "A nice hotel away from the touristy side of the city but close with metro access close by. The rooms are decent size for two adults. Both the bed and pillows are comfortable and the bathroom clean and also decent size. My biggest issue is how hot the room is. We turned on the \"AC\" and all it did was recirculate the air. You can open the window but there's a safety line not allowing you to open it fully. Called the reception to see if there's anything they could do about it and the answer is no. Since it's March they don't turn on the Cold option for the AC. And the safety line on the window they can't remove for safety reasons. I know the purpose for it but it's stupid not to allow the window to be opened fully to let cool air in. I'm from Florida and I know what hot feels like and our room was hot! It made it uncomfortable to sleep in. The fact that I sweat while sitting in the room after a day of walking around the city is unacceptable!\n\nThe breakfast they serve in the morning is typical continental buffet. You have options of scrambled eggs (bit too runny for me), sausages/small hotdogs, cold cuts, cheese, cereal and some breads. Coffee, water, and orange juice is also offered. ",

Do not recommend.\nPros: \nGood location - very close to the underground station Bogatell\nClean\nQuiet\nCons:\n- Far from the city center - no restaurants, no supermarkets (just small \"Super Markat\" where can buy only water, but nothing to eat) \n- Poor breakfast - the cooked breakfast includes only scrambled eggs and strange small tasteless sausages. \n- Breakfast starts on 07:00 (everywhere else begins in 06:30). Rude remark from the receptionist if you are there few minutes before 07:00 even though breakfast is ready and there are already people eating.\n- Must ask reception if you want room cleaning.\n- No TV programs in English. ONLY in Spanish\n- No glasses in the room. Just strange disposable cups in the bathroom.",

With the underground station Bogatell just a stone's throw away.\n\nAbout breakfast. We see you weren't thrilled with our scrambled eggs and sausages and we'll look into that, we do have over 44 products, including a Spanish omelette that's a real crowd-pleaser and hope you found something to your taste. Our breakfast starts at 7:00 am, but we’ll make sure to remind our team to greet you with a smile even if you're a bit ahead of time. \n\nWe are very aware of our impact on the environment, therefore if you want your room cleaned, just give us a call, and we'll take care of it for you! \n\nWhile our TV might have been chatting in Spanish, we do have English-speaking channels like the BBC to keep you company. Our team can help you out.\n\nIf you ever feel thirsty our bar with free water is open 24/7.\n\nWe hope that you will allow us the opportunity of providing you with an improved stay in future. \nAll the best,\n\nMª Carmen ORTIGOSA, General Manager",
