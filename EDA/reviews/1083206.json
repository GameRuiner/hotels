      "text": "Excellent Hotel centrally based for la Rambla and the gothic quarter. Walking distance from the beach and the Sagrada Familia. Lovely breakfast well worth the money. The rooms were comfortable  with a very large bed and the view from the top floor was fab as was the bar. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating.  A cab rank right outside was also very useful.  I would say the swimming pool is very small and more of a splash pool.\nThank you for a very enjoyable stay",

      "text": "This was our 3rd visit, never disappointed, always a very warm welcome with a complimentary glass of bubbly. This time we were celebrating my birthday, the staff were amazing, especially Natasha from reception, she had arranged for us to have a surprise glass of bubbly with our breakfast and then later that day a cake with a candle and birthday card arrived in our room, what a lovely surprise. \nThe hotel is well situated with just a short walk to the main street of Las Ramblas where there are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants as well as shops. The hotel terrace bar is a must with 360° views of the city. The rooms are excellent with unusual decor as well as the hotel itself. \nWe will definitely return again and would highly recommend to anyone.",

The surprise touches truly reflect the genuine care we aim to provide. \nYour commendations of our strategic location, a stone's throw away from the vibrant Las Ramblas, and the exclusive views from our terrace bar, reiterate the unique experiences we strive to offer our valued guests. It's gratifying to know that the distinctive decor of our rooms also enhanced your stay. \nWe take great pride in creating an atmosphere where guests feel compelled to return and are honored by your recommendation.\n\nWe look forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back on future occasions.\nBest regards,\n\nGabrielly Lacey\nAdjunta a Dirección / Assistant Manager",
