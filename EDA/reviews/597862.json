      "text": "My experience during the 2-day stay at Villa Rotana was fantastic. The hotel's location is incredibly convenient, within walking distance to the Business Bay metro station, supermarkets, restaurants, and shops. Additionally, the proximity to the Etihad Airways coach station, just a 5-minute walk away, made it extremely practical.\n\nThe staff at Villa Rotana were exceptionally friendly and eager to assist. Esraa the receptionist came to carry my giant heavy luggage when i reached the hotel entrance. Despite arriving for check-in at 4:30 pm and finding my room wasn't ready, Esraa promptly informed me it would be ready in 30 minutes and graciously offered me a temporary room to freshen up while I waited. This gesture was greatly appreciated.\n\nThe housekeeping team was also commendable, as they efficiently cleaned and mopped the living room floor of my suite the following day, knowing I had hosted friends there the previous evening.\n\nThe All Day Dining service and kitchen staff were equally friendly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast options available.\n\nOverall, my stay at Villa Rotana was excellent, and I will certainly be recommending it to friends and family.",
