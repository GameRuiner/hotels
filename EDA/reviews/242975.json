      "text": "My experience at Hotel Sofia was easily the best of any hotel I’ve been to. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel immediately welcome. From cab doors being opened on arrival, bags being taken straight to our rooms, and friendly smiles & hellos, to the extremely helpful reception staff - we could tell we’d made the right decision. \nThe rooms were perfect; modern, spacious, huge comfortable beds, and every amenity you could possibly need. \nThe facilities of the hotel were also top notch - the bar was a great experience with amazing drinks and attentive staff. The spa was so relaxing, and well worth visiting after a lot of walking around the City! The food and drinks were exceptional - with room service being a highlight for me. Fresh food at all hours, much needed after such long days exploring! \nOverall I can’t speak highly enough of my stay at the Hotel Sofia - luxurious, perfect location, amazing staff, just exceptional all round! If you’re going to Barcelona, you have to stay at Hotel Sofia.",

      "text": "The hotel was modern and relatively newly renovated with plenty of USB charging ports. The room was decent sized for European hotels. The staff were wonderful and professional. I had requested for additional water and body lotion, and everytime house keeping delivered in 5 min, very timely, and the staff were very courteous. The breakfast layout was typical of European 5 Star hotels. The hotel is not downtown but near Camp Nou, but the metro is close by, a 15 min metro ride and you would be close to everything. The only complaint is the bathroom layout, there was no place for me to put clean changing clothes. Our flight was in the morning and the hotel let us checkin by 11AM, which was very nice. Would strongly recommend to friends and family who don't mind not staying in the city center of barcelona.",

      "text": "This hotel is an amazingly brand new and beautiful finishing, we really enjoyed the stay. Since I am a Hyatt member, I was looking for a Hotel to stay with my 16-years-old son. To accommodate two men, two beds are absolutely required so this hotel came up as a top candidate among other Hyatt hotels. The decision was really right, or more than right, the stay brought us more than two beds. The staffs in the reception were friendly to us though we don’t speak Spanish fluently. They helped so many things. I had a concern on my FCB ticket bought on StubHub and I asked them a general advice. The team worked quickly and called FCB official ticket office and cleared my concern immediately. What a cool job. Lastly the location wise it seemed there was a distance from the central historical area, but taking metro L3 line we were able to access Plaza de Cataluña, Saglada Famila and Studio Olympics, and etc easily. The city of Barcelona is more compact than Tokyo, London and NYC there would be no problem in terms of access. I would rather emphasize the good access from the airport. It just took 20 mins from the hotel and costs only about 35 Euros. Remember how much you have to pay from JFK to NYC or suburbs these days. I would have to pay $200~ for large Uber Black. Lastly, we are so lucky to stay their Grand Hyatt rebranding opening day! I can’t wait to stay again, maybe after Camp Now renovation. The price will be skyrocketing after the renovation - I recommend to book early as you can. Camp Now is just a few mins walk from the Hotel.",
