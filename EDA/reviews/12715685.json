      "text": "This was our second trip to the Iberostar Selection Passeig de Gràcia and it was just as wonderful as the first time!\n\nWe were in touch with the amazing Nawal Kayou from Guest Services throughout our stay, who made sure we felt special and valued from the first day of our trip to the last. She even shared some gifts with us knowing it was our second lengthy stay at the hotel which we loved! This is why she manages guest services - because she’s obviously great at making the guest experience special! Thank you, Nawal! \n\nThe staff at the hotel were so accommodating, especially given that we arrived much earlier than expected. While the room we requested wasn’t yet ready because the previous guests were still checking out, the front desk team offered to store our bags while we ventured into the city for a few hours. We were alerted when the room was available and were able to get settled into our temporary home for the next 11 days. \n\nThe room itself was still fantastic, with the most incredible views of Barcelona.  (we were in the corner terrace room) I still love the fact that there is a refillable carafe for water, which is so much more sustainable than offering bottled water, not to mention kind for not charging $3 a bottle! The rain shower is also wonderful, so much so that I’m attempting to copy this in my apartment in NYC!\n\nI can’t say enough about the team in Ca Menestral, the on-site restaurant we had our daily breakfast at. They were always so kind and some of them even remembered us from last year! Thanks to Chris, Alessandro, Jennifer x2, Gemma, and the others whose names I didn’t get but were so kind and accommodating. \n\nFrom the room and the views to the location, from the entire staff both front of house and back, this was another amazing experience at this hotel and my partner and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a clean, comfortable, and perfectly centrally located stay in one of the best cities in the world. \n\nThanks again to the Iberostar team for making our time in Catalonia an unforgettable experience!",

No one walked past without a smile and an “Hola”\nThe rooms are bright, clean, modern and spacious. There are water/ice machines in the corridors which we loved. \nThe breakfast was really good with hot options available from a menu and cold options available from buffet. Such a nice relaxing breakfast and was a great way to start the day. \nWould absolutely stay here again if i return to Barcelona, and would recommend it to everyone. \nPs. The hotel smells amazing!",

Lovely clean and comfortable room. Housekeeping staff deserve a special mention. Room was serviced and kept immaculate during our stay. Was also quiet despite overlooking a very busy road. We did not have breakfast as part of our stay as preferred to explore the local area for meals. Used the Skybar one afternoon and the view was amazing. I would definitely return to this hotel.",
