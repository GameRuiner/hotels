      "text": "I have stayed here for 5 days and the experience is beyond awesome. \n\nThe front door and reception area catch my eyes first. They are a magnificent introduction to the hotel's commitment to beauty and comfort, making a strong first impression. The staffs are also very nice and warm. \n\nThe room is spacious and clean, which I appreciated a lot. Moreover, I stayed in one of the city view room on the high floors. From the room I can directly see many attractions in Barcelona, such as La Sagrada Familia, Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and Olympic Ring. I am also able to watch the sunrise from Mediterranean Sea on my bed, which is a very unique experience for me. \n\nThe breakfast is amazing. The croissants and honeydew melon are the best I have had. And the club lounge offers real and great tapas in the evening. The lounge also have a great collection of beverages and alcoholic ones. \n\nAs to the location, I had no trouble during my stay to find the bus or metro to the city center of Barcelona. The hotel is very close to bus station and metro station. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this hotel to tourists .",

      "text": "We have been here many times.  The hotel tower itself is very impressive and luxurious.  It rises above all its surroundings.  The rooms are larger than expected and very well designed.  The view from the room is extraordinary.  The staff are professional, friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast is very good with high standards.  The restaurant \"le petite chef\" is a unique experience, highly recommended even if one is not a guest of the hotel.  The show, entertainment and animation are fantastic, the food is top quality and the service is absolutely top.  It should definitely receive a Michelin rating.  The Regency Club is fantastic and better than other hotels.  The rooms are well clean, well equipped and maintained.  The only bad thing is that surely eventually the check out time will come.  The location is very good.  On the one hand, it is not in the center of the city, so the surroundings are not too crowded and have everything one needs: supermarket, barbershop, bakery, market, pharmacy, restaurants and so on.  On the other hand, there is very comfortable and economical public transport to the city center and anywhere else. Bottom line: a very good choice.",
