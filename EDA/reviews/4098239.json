      "text": "Otelin odaları bakımsız, klimaları bozuk, duş aparatları eskimiş ve bozuk. Personel ilgili ancak sorun otelin fiziki şartlarında. Sabah çarşafta böcek izleri vardı. Sorduğumda ise dışarıdan sinek giriyor dediler. Ancak gündüz cam kapalalı olduğu halde ertesi sabah gene böcek ve ısırık izi ve kan lekesi vardı. Resmini çekip gösterdiğim resepsiyon memuru ise oralı bile olmadı. Galiba diğer odalarda da aynı sorun vardı. Buzdolapları soğutmuyor ancak çalıştığı için odayı ısıtmaya yarıyordu. Yaz günü için kötü bir durum. Yapılan yorumlar ile otelin ilgisi dahi yoktu. \n\nThe rooms of the hotel are neglected, the air conditioners are broken, the shower apparatus is old and broken. The staff is related, but the problem is in the physical conditions of the hotel. In the morning there were traces of insects on the bed sheet. When I asked, they said that flies are coming in from outside. However, even though the window was closed during the day, the next morning there were insect and bite marks and blood stains again. The receptionist, whose picture I took and showed, was not even there. I think other rooms had the same problem. The refrigerators did not cool, but because they worked, they did serve to warm the room. Bad situation for a summer day. The hotel had nothing to do with the comments made.",

      "text": "I was in Walk-in Hotel for a night last weekend.\nI was in Izmir for my IELTS exam and I found Walk-in Hotel from the map which is close by to the education centre where I took my exam.\nI booked a single room which is facing the back and preferred because the front is facing to a roundabout might be noisy due to the traffic congestion.\nThe room is not very spacious but I do not expect a bigger room for the value I paid.But the biggest issue is in the shower ...Once you open the glass door of the shower it is nearly impossible to get in even I am only 80 kgs.Also, the drainer is not working properly, therefore, there is being a leakage from the edge of the shower.\nThe manager Nurhan and the receptionists Emrah and the blond lady are extremely kind.I would be rating this hotel 3 but rated 4 because of the polite staff.\nThe breakfast buffet is reasonable for the value.\nLocation is unbeatable, you are within walk distance to everywhere.\nCarpark is not a problem.They take your car to a carpark for 10 tl daily which is a great service.\nRecommended for the ones who are busy in the city centre.",
