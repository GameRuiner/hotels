      "text": "I checked in late at night and was met by a rather rude and disinterested person at the front desk. My room was average to say the least. One old towel, wallpaper peeling from the wall, lights in bathroom rusting. Towel rack is loose. Water luke warm. Curtains look like they come from a cheap motel in America. Breakfast was ordinary. Found a hair in my pineapple. Coffee cold and no taste and no milk available. Tried the gym. Half the equipment not working. Absolutely disgusting gym. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. Last time I will set foot in it. Four star hotel, no more than two star.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, this was one of the worst places I have ever stayed in, particularly in Dubai. As other reviews have stated, the hotel is not only dated, it is run down and tatty. I arrived late at night to be shown to a room that smelled like someone had been smoking in it, which made it unbearable to stay in. The carpet was dirty, with a soggy wet patch, where cleaning of the carpet had clearly been attempted. The bathroom was similarly disappointing. It was smelly, only had one towel, no bath mat, which made it dangerous to get in and out of the bath when feet were wet. Hot water took a very long time to come, which meant standing cold in the shower for ages. The bath also had mouldy silicone around the edge. Communal areas were also indicative of the hotel having seen better days. I cannot fault the staff who I engaged with, who were helpful and polite. Unfortunately, this hotel was unacceptable and we checked out the morning after an unpleasant night's sleep. \n\nThe hotel is in a wonderful location and would be vastly improved with some investment.",
