      "text": "Fabulous hotel with extremely well appointed apartments with fully functional kitchen. Small onsite restaurant offers a comprehensive breakfast with a varied buffet. Eggs are cooked to order by competent chefs. Lunch and evening meals are available on demand. The one bedroom apartment was massive with high quality fittings and presented in excellent condition. The daily housekeeping was exceptional. There is a rooftop swimming pool with lifeguard in attendance. Being in a low rise area the pool has sun all day. All staff members were exceptional with a can do attitude. Easy access from the airport with many low cost dining options within walking distance. The main bus stop is opposite the hotel with a 5min ride to the metro station. Taxis are freely available as the Eagle Restaurant adjacent to the hotel is the main dining venue for drivers 24/7. Excellent value hotel.",
