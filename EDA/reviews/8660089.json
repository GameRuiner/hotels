      "text": "This hotel was chosen for me by the dental company I used.\nGood points: pleasant looking hotel, close to supermarket and optimum mall. Lovely big room and very comfortable bed. Hotel always smelt nice and was very clean! Two small complementary bottles of water per day which was a nice touch. Usual complementary shower gels etc.\nBad points: on a very busy road and not really the place for peace and quiet! Hotel is advertised with sun terrace and there are pictures of it on the website. However I was told ‘conference only’ so very disappointing that there was no outdoor space. Your website is inaccurate and needs changing. Only a very small balcony where you could only get half a chair on! Overlooked back of supermarket and busy side street. No proper swimming pool even though advertised with one!\nThe first 7 nights were included in my dental treatment plan so I stayed an extra 4 nights and I was told by the dental company it would be a certain amount but the hotel would not honour this price so I ended up paying extra. Not much but still not very good customer service from hotel.\nHotel served a purpose but would not stay here again through choice.",
