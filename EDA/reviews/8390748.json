      "text": "Wow !!! I think this place is destined to fail I’m sorry to say because it is a lovely location. £250 a night out of season for a small room with no bath and builders and noise everywhere (the place is looking rather tatty) so I understand the renovations but I don’t want to pay to hear them !!! My next issue £50 for 2 single gin and tonics (Gordon’s) seriously I’ve stayed all over the world and never payed that even at that burj al Arab !!! Very dissatisfied very overpriced. I may be wrong but I sense this is probably a franchise operation I just can’t see Marriot group being so short sited and greedy.",

      "text": "Beautiful hotel in a great location. This was our second visit having loved staying here before. But……….\nNegatives: \n1. We specifically booked & requested a twin room when booking and emailed several times to confirm this but arrived to find we were allocated a single king size bed. My daughter & I wanted separate beds so it became clear that they had to open up a room to facilitate this on a floor that was actually closed. Thats when the problems started. Don’t offer a room if it’s not ready & available. \n2. The room air con did not work for 2 days and then broke down. Each time they did fix it but we spent one very hot night and one very cold night as the thermostat was broken. \n3. We had no hot water for one day. Not great after a day by the pool. It was fixed. \n4. When trying to report air con issue we discovered the high tech phone did not work. It looked fancy but that was it. It never worked during our stay. \n5. TV in our room offered only two English speaking channels - BBC & Sky international news. A minor irritation but for such a hotel and in this day & age disappointing. \n6. Major building works going on. In fairness it is early in the season but very frustrating to be by the pool and all you can hear is drilling, banging, saws going, dust etc. Guests should be warned and prices should reflect the disruption. \n7. The lovely infinity pool needed repairing. Large chunks of plaster had fallen off it. Not a good look. \n8. Lighting around the hotel was either faulty or not finished with wires on display. \n9. Safe in room did not work. \nNow for the positives:\n1. Food was lovely and great options. My daughter is coeliac and staff could not have been more helpful. \n2. Staff were lovely. \n3. Location perfect. \n4. Room itself was lovely and bed was super comfortable. \nSummary: I’m sure the problems we encountered will be sorted by the time the season is underway but at least warn guests that building work is going on and ensure rooms are fully functional and reflect the disruption in the price of the room.",

      "text": "Excellent location right on the water. We had a room with a sea view and access direct to the beach area - it was a fabulous room in fairness. Great staff and lovely hotel overall. Only downside was the price of food and drink - very very expensive. €38 plus service charge for a cocktail! €20 for a glass of wine, €10 beer. You could easily spend more eating at the hotel than on the room. This seems par for the course in Bodrum at the moment in the international hotels. Much much cheaper in local restaurants.",
