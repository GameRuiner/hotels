As an interior designer, the hotel is gorgeous having been designed by a famous architect.  The rooms are luxurious and we also had lunch at the roof top bar overlooking the city.\nAnd did I mention all the various choices for the breakfast buffet? Please do not hesitate to book your stay here!",

      "text": "I have so many nice things to say about this hotel.  I just loved the vibe of Casa Fuster, from the aromatheraphy scent as I entered, which followed me to my room with a view of the street and amazing sunset, to a beautiful welcome sweet treats.  My friend who lives part time in Barcelona recommended this hotel , but I was reluctant a bit as it was farther up the street.  So I split my Barcelona stay between two hotels.  I wanted to test both for the next time when I come with my husband.   My room was decent in size and had good energy,  also had a cool balcony and a jacuzzi tub which I used immediately.  High end toiletries and the most comfortable bedding by far.  I slept like a baby with no jetlag.  It is a very well managed and organized hotel. from customer service, check in, to little special accents that put a smile on my face.  There were no hicupps and everyone was very pleasent.  The breakfast was lovely and had many choices, also to my surprise Casa Fuster had my favorite Ronnefeldt tea!!  So I must add extra star for this.  I did not use any other facilities as I only spent one night at the hotel.  I  will defintely choose Casa Fuster next time, assuming I will get a nice room with the view ;) hopefully I will catch the jazz night.  Keep up great work and thank you.",
