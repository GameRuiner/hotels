Great decor and pictures throughout.\nWe arrived around 4am, having booked the hotel for an extra night we checked in straight away. Swam , extremely friendly and helpful member of staff ,checked us in brought our bags up to our room. \nWe had booked corner room with beach view looking over West beach. \nThe room had all that you would need, hairdryer, iron/ ironing board , kettle, TV,Nespresso machine , complimentary water and the most amazing smelling toiletries.\nThe bed was really comfortable, the room was cleaned daily, water was replenished daily , towels changed daily. Housekeeping staff did a fantastic job.\nThe restaurant on site MM served all you could possibly want for breakfast,fruits, pastries, juices,cooked breakfast etc…\n We ate at the restaurant for dinner one night the food was also great.\nThe hotel has a rooftop pool and here you get a great view towards Ain Dubai. It also has loungers on the beach for hotel guests. \nThe main thing at the hotel for me was the staff .. everyone seems genuinely interested in you, asking about your day ,remembering where you said you would visit  that day , what your doing etc… \nOverall a superb hotel.",
