There are a few kebab restaurants within a 5 minute walk from the main entrance. \n\nThe breakfast is outstanding, one of the best spreads we've ever seen. The wifi is very good here as well.\n\nWe would stay here again.",

It is also close to the main square( Saat kulesi) and konak open market (bazaar). We made the reservation at booking.com and booked the cheapest economy room for 2 nights. The room was big and clean with modern furniture, the bathroom was also nice. There was no balcony in the room but it is not necessary cause the hotel stands on the noisy street. I havent seen standart rooms but I think they must be perfect. The staff is nice and friendly. I did not like the breakfast, it seemed to me that some dishes such as fried eggs were not fresh. But anyway for the price that we paid the hotel is wonderful)",
