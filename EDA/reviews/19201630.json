      "text": "Firstly I'll say that the hotel is very clean, modern, and looks newly refurbished. The staff were all very helpful and fantastic.\nHowever, they have 3 birds (including a parrot) which they keep locked up in tiny cages which was quite upsetting! And also, completely unnecessary!! Having pet birds doesn't add any value to a hotel. Parrots are very intelligent animals and it is cruel to keep them locked in such a small space.\nThe location of the hotel is in a very dodgey part of Izmir! It felt quite unsafe leaving the hotel at night time. There are no nice restaurants or cafes within close walking distance. If I ever come back to Izmir I would prefer to be staying near the water/pier as that is where all the nice places are. The rooms were also tiny, and the wifi doesn't work very well. The staff were very helpful on the last day when my dad got sick with pneumonia - they helped him find a doctor to see, and allowed us to have a late check out that day so we had enough time to go to the doctor and come back! So we were very grateful for that! Staff were also very helpful with organising a tour to Ephesus and back aswell.",
