The staff really make this hotel, and are endlessly courteous and helpful. We especially loved the dive trip with Sharaf, Diaa and the boat captain Aymen. The onboard lunch was delicious. Thanks to Ahmed and Mahmoud who made our room look spotless everyday. Itâ€™s expensive but not really for what you get. We will be back !",
