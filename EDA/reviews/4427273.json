The choice of food was very poor, under-stocked and lukewarm. This was the case for both dinner and breakfast.\nOverall, the hotel could do with some refurbishment and a reorganisation and expansion of the reception/restaurant area.\nOn a positive note, the staff I engaged with were pleasant, and the bed was very comfortable.",
