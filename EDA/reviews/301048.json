      "text": "The hotel was near everything. The buffet was adequate and even good some days. The rooms were not so big and only had a window. The shower was a bit broken at some parts and the towels were torn. They didn't replace our glasses and cups. The elevator was small and that didn't make it easy for us to carry our baggage. Also the staff wasn't so friendly and helpful after all and the fact that they didn't speak english very well was a big problem. At first, I confess I was excited about it but later I got very disappointed. I guess it is okay for a short term stay in the city.",

Convenient location with many shops and restaurants, about 600 m to the sea, nearby a big park and also Basmane railway station and underground station. \nRooms are big enough, air conditioned, with coffee and tea facilities and complemantary water. Very good price for such a hotel. Breakfast sufficient, not too good coffee, but big choice  of local meal. to the airport with taxi, it takes about half an hour and costs about 10 Euros.",

However the customer service is poor the front of house were rude and the manager very argumentative and a little aggressive in her manner. Deapite already booking a room through booking.com I was charged double on arrival and despite being told the hotel had refunded the booking.com payment they had not. Also the breakfast was incredible poor and no room service was avaliable",
