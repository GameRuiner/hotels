      "text": "This was our first visit to Barcelona and although with city breaks we don’t plan on staying in the room/ hotel too long we still are very picky and nervous when searching for the right hotel. This one did not disappoint. \n\nReception\nOur flight was early (before check in) on arrival and late (after check out) on departure. This was no problem for the hotel as there is a locker room you can use to keep your cases in whilst you go out exploring more the city. \n\nSafety\nThere is extra security and safety measures regarding who can go to the rooms / floors and bar area as you have to scan your room key card to access which was great and made us feel very safe. \n\nBar area\nBar area on the top floor was calming and some great entertainment such as cocktail making, beer tasting or live music on selected days. We didn’t get a chance to use this but we did arrive half way through a beer tasting to have a quick drink before leaving for dinner and it looked great. There is also a pool however due to drought in Barcelona currently and being March not really the weather to use it, the pool was closed. \n\nRoom\nBeautiful rooms, simple yet for us that works. Room has a tv, shower toilet the usual stuff. A small clothing area but we only hung a few things so wasn’t an issue. The best feature I must say was the Bluetooth built in speakers you can connect to and the free WiFi. This was amazing and I know both us and my mother in law in her room used this frequently. \n\nRoom - Constructive Feedback\nOnly thing I’d give as constructive feedback is it would be great if the standard rooms could have a fridge (not sure if the other rooms have this already) however we like to purchase bottles of water and snacks from a local shop when on any holiday or city break and we have to be selective this time with what we brought back (no fresh milk for e.g). The only other thing is a small pillow selection. My mother in law loved the pillows however, my partner and I found them to be too soft. It would have been nice to have maybe even 1 soft and 1 firm as a selection in the rooms. \n\nOverall\nThis isn’t a be all end all for us. We plan to visit Barcelona again in the future and would 100% stay here again. Thank you for having us.",
