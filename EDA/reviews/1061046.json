      "text": "Husband and I currently live overseas and travel in Europe frequently. We decided to visit Ephesus and head out from Izmir using Viator (owned by Trip Advisor) or Get your Guide v. renting a car. Wise choice as parking in Izmir would be a nightmare, and the underground garage at this hotel also looked like a stressful situation. We originally booked at Swiss, but then decided to save some money. We looked at this 13/154 rating in Trip Advisor (not sure how they came up w/that good nos), and based on ranking and reviews, we decided to stay here.\nThe good - rooms are very clean and housekeeping came each day. Mini-fridge in room, which was nice. TV has 2-3 English-speaking news channels which we found. Management must have recently put in fake vinyl flooring v. carpet, which was a plus. Bed mattress firm and slept fine (except for bottom sheet quality, which I will get to soon). Breakfast is good and has a variety of a Turkish items - if you like olives and cheese, there are many to choose from. There were boiled and omelette-type eggs.  Honeycomb and fresh bread, store-bought cake or cookies (one of each on a plate). Same bfast each of 5 days we stayed.  Unfortunately, no yogurt..turns out Turks eat yogurt from noon onwards, not bfast. Staff were pleasant enough - shout out to Katar and Elgin. LOCATION OF THIS HOTEL is best thing - much better located to bazaar, clock tower, Agora and main sights of Izmir that Movenpic, Swissotel, or Park by Radison.  They are several blocks north.\nThe BAD - DARK rooms. When I say dark - the pictures shown, if not enhanced, must be taken on a summer day at noon. No overhead lighting, and the 2 sconces on either side of bed just didn't cut it.  The bed we got (And what i saw when i peeked in some rooms getting cleaned) was a  double - NOT a queen. The headboard was clearly for a queen or king, but we weren't keen on the double, but had no choice. There are only 2 outlets (mentioned in a review) which didn't bother us, but be aware. The 24/7 coffee/cappuccino machine was odd. no milk was coming out and final result definitely not a cappuccino. in fact, they must know it is older machine, bc they always had a pot of coffee and another large carafe of coffee near machine at bfast. We had a city/street view - not bad, and double-paned windows kept out most of the noise, but we were on top (5th) floor, so can't speak for rooms below.\nThe UGLY - the linens. First, the sheets - the bottom sheet was so pilled, i asked for it to be changed next day. The next one not much better. The duvet was a single, yet on a double bed. We didn't ask for another, but it was a tug and pull with my husband, sometimes at night as it barely covered the double (not queen) bed. Second, THE TOWELS - isn't Turkey known for its' Turkish Towels and textiles? These towels, although sized-well need to be replaced. They were old, needed bleach and were so overwashed and thin, we actually asked for replacements each day. If management would invest in some good, thicker towels and tell guests they won't be replaced even that would work.\nFinally, as one mentioned earlier - do NOT try to save money with lowest room bc your window will be actually looking into the hotel and very small room. Good location, good for 1-2 night stay; and, just lower your expectations on rest.",
