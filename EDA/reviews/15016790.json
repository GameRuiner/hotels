      "text": "I have many comments about this hotel regarding the service, I understand that it is Ramadan but the service should work but for the price this hotel is really not worth it! to make a person wait 2-3 hours for food on the beach, then an hour there for a beer, they cleaned our room but did not refill the minibar, these are fatal mistakes, I think they should propose a solution automatically and not with the final bill at the end of the day, I will leave it to them explain and then we will agree on the price, the food on the beach much worse than in the hotel, I got hard ham in the César salad! regarding the pedicure at the hotel, a friend went for it and the pedicure didn't even last 24 hours and the gentleman was very unpleasant, what did she say she did during the day? after we went to deal with it, he returned the opiment, my friend spent 3 hours on that pedicure, who should I praise, the girl, I don't know her name now, I think she is from Africa, she tried very hard to do everything great, very nice lady and then the manager of the restaurant who tried to accommodate us, it bothers me that when you call the manager after mistakes, they all give us business cards, it also doesn't seem normal to me to wait 20 minutes for a sunbed on the beach as a hotel guest, I was in another hotel on the palm tree and behind lower price and I thought it was better in that hotel, it can't happen, as for the Wi-Fi on the beach, it keeps dropping out, it would be nice to fix it, a person goes to rest for 4 days and doesn't want to deal with such things, they won't give him a card if you charge your phone and then they won't find it? otherwise as for the breakfast and dinner in the buffet restaurant, they were good and a lot of choice! we liked it",

It was a very nice hotel that had a great pool and was good for kids but wasn’t something for me. If you do not enjoy loud noises or constantly partying, this isn’t for you.",

      "text": "Difficult to review in short but can’t help feeling a little disappointed with this hotel and its service and general feel. \nThe service at meal times is slow and reactive to requests. Little to no proactive service levels here (with the exception of the pool staff). Takes at least 1/2hr to get a drink with breakfast and never once been asked if we wanted a drink with dinner. \nThe music is good, but as I sit here on my balcony, I’ve got 3 lots of loud music (I like music, I’m very into my DJ vibe!) but 3 lots blasting at once so you can’t hear any clearly is just not the one. \nSeems if you jump breakfast queues, spend money on extras and ask constantly for service you’ll get on better here. Maybe I’m too polite. \nThe good bits are, it’s clean, the interiors are nice, the beds are comfy, the food is actually good variety and taste and there is free water. \nMore than a little disappointed for the cost of this holiday. We won’t be returning.",

Esham always left the room clean and smelling great.
