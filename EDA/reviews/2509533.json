      "text": "In my few days' vacation in Antalya, I had the opportunity to stay at this extraordinary hotel, which truly deserves praise in every aspect. The hotel is created by restoring several historic mansions within a garden setting. The rooms are spacious and airy, with new and practical furnishings, and every detail has been thoughtfully considered. The staff is highly professional, attentive, and hospitable. I especially want to extend my special thanks to Ümit Bey. Hygiene is very important to me, and the hotel stands out in this regard, it's spotless. The breakfast, with its wide variety of options to suit every taste, is truly legendary. Located in the old city within the castle area, it's peaceful and close to the sea. Across the street from the hotel, you can enjoy the greenery and the sea at any time in the park. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to everyone; I was thoroughly satisfied in every way.",

The breakfast is served next door at the restaurant, it's a buffet that as a good selection of food.\nThe rooms are basic but clean and they are cleaned daily to a good standard, the only negative was the beds were too hard for me personally.\nOverall the hotel is a good standard and I would stay there again and would recommend to anyone that is looking to book a 3 star Hotel.",

      "text": "I love this hotel. The staff are great, very welcoming and accommodating. My room had a sea view and it was the perfect size with everything I needed. It was clean and although it was close to the centre and my room was next to the street, it wasn't too noisy. There's a great choice for breakfast and you can sit inside or outside. There's the option of room service for dinner too. I ate there twice in the evening and had a lovely meal both times.  Lots of beds around the pool - everything is spotlessly clean and there's a small gym area. There is a beach a few minutes walk away and it's great for swimming.  The beds are raised up above the sea and although they are close together it's very peaceful. Food service is available and not expensive. Loads of shops and restaurants to choose from within 5 minutes walk. I would definitely go back to the Puding Hotel.",
