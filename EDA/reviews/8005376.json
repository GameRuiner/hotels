We loved that we could easily walk to the center of the city, the seaside and the old town. \nThe staff is polite, special thanks to Ezgi who was always very helpful (!!). The only thing that was not great was the bedding, we sadly found the pillows were not very comfortable but it’s something that can be easily fixed vu the management in the future",
