I was amazed by the pictures and the water front view. The name says it all. Right? And the price wasnâ€™t bad. So I booked one night. I arrived super late around 3 am in the morning. As I was picking up the key I told the receptionist make sure you give a water front view. He said I am sorry you booked a standard room. I cannot give you a waterfront view. \n\nI would understand if the description says no water front view. I drove 45 minuted just to go to a more expensive room with a parking lot view. This ridiculous.\n\nCustomer service is super bad description of the room on booking is super misleading. \nThe place is way too far. The AC in the room was not working properly. And I also forgot to mention it took me 20 minutes to locate the hotel because the location  link on booking took me else where. And I had to get a location message via WhatsApp from the hotel receptionist to get to the hotel. If you are traveling business I WOULD NOT USE THIS HOTEL. \nAt all.",
