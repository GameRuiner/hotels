      "text": "One of the best rooms I've ever stayed in. Two floors room where kids had a blast. The management was excellent hosts where Ozan at the front desk made everything smooth and catered to all our needs. This hotel is in an industrial area but if you have your own car it takes only 10 minutes to teach the city. Positively you're saved from the hustle bustle and the traffic. However the rooms the management the price makes up for the location . I would rate it one of the highest in my stays all over the world! Thank Ozan thanks Ramada keep it up üëç",
