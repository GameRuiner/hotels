      "text": "Can't fault this hotel. The staff were all lovely, friendly and helpful. We stayed in a triple room that was spacious with an enormous double and a single. The beds were comfortable and clean. The waterfall shower was great. Had a look.at the pool but too cold to go for a dip in January.  Mini bar was well stocked and very reasonably priced (€2 for a can of coke) Metro stop is 5 minutes walk away and there are plenty of shops/restaurants in the local area. Sagrada is a 20 minute walk\n away. Didn't have breakfast there so can't comment. Yhe only tiny negative, the cups were too small for a decent cuppa and no hotel guide in the room.\n",

It's very conveniently located with a metro station approximately 3-4 minutes walk away with easy connections to many top attractions. Walking distance of Sagrada di Familia. Rooms were clean and modern. Hotel staff are very professional and polite especially Maru and Ilona who were super helpful. Always a big smile and lovely greeting everytime we entered or left the building which made our stay a very pleasant one! \nUnable to comment on the food/restaurant as we didn't get a chance to try it out. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Barcelona.",
