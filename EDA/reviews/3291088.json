      "text": "The hotel is located near the metro station, just a 1-minute walk to the hotel. A supermarket is available next to the hotel, and there is a park nearby. At check-in, Madara and Angalin were very friendly and welcoming. The room is spacious, neat, and clean. Special thanks to Thanu, who took the lead and initiated the arrangement of the bed for a birthday setup and looked after our stay. Definitely, we will not miss out on mentioning the staff's names from Housekeeping, Osta and Chandra, who assisted us with our requests. It's good to see that sustainability practices are in place, including in the room and public areas. See you soon.",
