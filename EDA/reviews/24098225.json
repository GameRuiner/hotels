It's great that you enjoyed the breakfast and found our hall area cozy – we love it when guests feel at home. And yes, our rooftop is indeed the perfect spot to unwind after a day out in Barcelona! Sorry to hear about the noise issue, though; it seems Barcelona's vibrant energy can sometimes be a little too enthusiastic. Rest assured, we're always looking for ways to ensure our guests have the most restful stay possible.\n\nIt would be a pleasure to welcome you back in the future. \nKind regards,\n\nCasa Lit Barcelona by Ona",

We're genuinely sorry to hear about the issues with the TV remote and the momentary Wi-Fi outage- it's a disappointed when tech doesn't work as it should. However, I'm happy to say that these were temporary hiccups and were resolved for you promptly. \n\nRegarding the kettle, we do have one available at reception 24/7 for guests to use, although we understand it's more convenient to have one in the room. And about the fridge, it seems there was a bit of a mix up as our rooms don't typically include one, and our room amenities are clearly stated in our description to avoid any surprises. \n\nWe would like to clarify that our receptionist was trying to propose a room change that was more in line with your expectations when you ended the call, and despite further attempts to contact you there has been no reply. Our priority is our guests wellbeing and we hope that the rest of your stay is more to your satisfaction.\n\nKind regards,\n\nCasa Lit Barcelona by Ona",

      "text": "Casa Lit does honor it's name. Bright, spacious, clean, yet relaxed atmosphere. Rooms aren't big (yet big enoug)  but feel larger because of use of mirrors and light. Good bed, clean nice bathroom. I slept streetside second floor with window open  (don't like aircocondition) no problem with noise. Hallway has a luxurious feel. Major assets: rooftop and the  area where one can sit, with sofas, seats, a workspace and lockers. It's next to the breakfast area which is a nice place and breakfast is good. Ample choice, fresh good stuff.\nLocation perfect when you need to be in harbour. Street doesn't look good but it didn't matter (there's a policestation one block away round the corner). Within couple minutes walk from metro. You can easily walk to Barri Gothic and Ramblas.\nLast but not least: the staff! Such friendly helpfull people, kudos for them 😀",

      "text": "Arrived late at 7.30 pm and immediately went out for something to eat . The surrounding area isn't to the standard of the hotel but we enjoyed a meal at Asian ways and a couple of beers . I would recommend the Thai restaurant which cost about 50 pounds but with starters , main meals and 2 rounds of beers . Went back and had another couple of drinks at the hotel rooftop bar . This was reasonably priced and had a small pool as well. Probably a great place after a day out sight seeing to chill out. Staff were outstanding . Very attentive and polite and spoke excellent English which helped when asking for directions . Room slightly small but decorated to a high standard . Would have been 5 star if in a better area ",
