      "text": "Best best best holiday ever!\n\nWe originally had booked to stay at the Atrium Platinum resort but this was cancelled with 2 weeks to go and Atrium offered us an upgrade at the Palace resort on the east coast. Naturally we jumped at the chance but this wasn't just an upgrade.\n\nThe hotel was amazing, pure luxury and probably a holiday that we will never be able to replicate!\n\nThe staff really made it a holiday to remember. They really couldn't do enough to help and as we left we bumped into the hotel manager and we had to let him know how proud he should be of his amazing team.\n\nWe have to mention Gabriella, Davida, Artiola, Zuzanna, Valentina, Marianna, Katerina, Beatrice and Pari as they obviously worked so hard and made us feel so welcome. Thank you guys!\n\nWe got to stay in a superior villa which had loads of room, enough for myself and my wife to have some privacy. It also had a jacuzzi and beautiful private pool which was cleaned every day. The villa was visited by cleaning staff at least twice a day which seemed nuts but the hotel obviously prided itself on keeping everything in a wonderful state.\n\nThree days into the holiday we were offered an upgrade to the presidential villa! It was becoming available and would we like to use it for the remainder of our stay? The superior villa had more than enough room but the presidential villa was crazy big. It had a large separate room for our two daughters which meant that me and my wife had even more privacy. The private, heated pool actually wrapped around the side of the building and we couldn't believe how lucky we were.\n\nThe food and restaurants at the hotel were really what interested me the most. This was definitey not quantity over quality. It was just sheer quality and I woke up every day giddy with the thought of the variety available to us - local fish, anchovies, dolmades, freshly baked bread, a huge variety of salad, grains, humus, tzatziki and the list goes on, always too much to choose from. Our daughters were in heaven and had cake for breakfast each day and we didn't care because we knew they would burn it off in the huge pools. Every meal turned into a 3, 4 or 5 course affair.\n\nI used the hotel gym most days and it was really well kitted out. Multiple sets of weights in different forms, kettle bells, dumbells, different bars, multiple cross trainers and multiple treadmills and rowing machines. It was super clean and was happily child free!\n\nThe icing on the cake was how well the hotel and grounds were looked after. It was a pleasure to walk around and the holiday wasn't just about getting from our room to the pool, restaurant or beach. The paths were all tiled beautifully, the many many flower beds maintained perfectly and the creeping/hanging plants were in flower and gave the hotel a peaceful, paradise feel.\n\nIt's safe to say we were sad to leave. We may never have a holiday like that again but the team at Atrium made it one to remember.",
