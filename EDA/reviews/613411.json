Rooms are reasonable size. Beach is small but private and clean . There are 2 pools including slides . Located on busy street of hurghada you have everything close by. And if u feel like going to KFC or McDonalds it’s just across the street. I would definitely recommend it.. Animation team doing their best .. Aqua gym is always fun!",
