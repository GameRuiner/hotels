      "text": "The location of the Barcelona Intercontinental is rather awkward, situated outside the city center. Returning to the hotel from the nearby shopping mall at night poses safety concerns, necessitating the use of a taxi. On one occasion, a taxi driver became agitated upon realizing how little she earned from our trip, even insisting that we pay the minimum charge of 7 euros instead of the meter charge 4 euros. Despite her proficient English, I asked the doorman to clarify the driver's request, which she eventually withdrew. However, another guest waiting at the hotel's entrance was less fortunate as no taxi was available.\n\nDuring check-in, the front desk staff neglected to inquire whether we preferred a twin or double bed, assigning us a double bed room at the end of the corridor instead. Despite this oversight, Sergi, went above and beyond to assist us. He demonstrated exceptional helpfulness and patience, repeatedly moving heavy luggage to ensure our satisfaction. Additionally, he offered us an umbrella without us even realizing it was raining outside.  Kamel's warm hospitality made us feel at home, while concierge members Gema and Mara provided valuable information. Gema even remembered to return a forgotten power bank upon our departure.  Yet not all concierge staff were equally competent. One member failed to check thoroughly whether the museum was indeed located in the nearby city, resulting in unnecessary expenses of around 100 euros for train and taxi fares to nowhere. My sister had followed his advice to visit the church first, leading to disappointment and frustration.\n\nFurthermore, the hotel's instant service operators failed to fulfill their duties promptly. Despite assuring us that they would clear the mini-bar, it took until the third request for them to do so. Upon completion, the staff member left our room with a displeased expression. Later on the same evening, we were surprised to find two glasses and bottles of water placed on our bedside table when we returned to the room after speaking with the concierge. This was not provided to us on our first day, and even if it is standard practice, such services should ideally be completed before 6 p.m. It is concerning when staff enter our room while we are inside, and it poses a possible safety issue when we are out, as no staff should enter the room without our permission.   When I raised these issues with the duty manager who simply dismissed them as mere comments without providing any explanation.  However, Anna from guest services showed a more proactive approach by addressing my concerns and providing at least some explanations which although I still could not be convinced.\n\nSuch service discrepancies continued, with the morning wake-up call scheduled for 6:45 a.m. not being executed until 6:53 a.m.  It would matter as we have to hurry to catch the train schedule.   Frankly speaking, without the aforementioned staff, this hotel would be the worst Intercontinental experience I've had.",
