      "text": "Fabulous stay at The Castellum Suites!\nI don’t often write reviews, but having read the one below, I felt it fair to counter some of the contents of the previous post.\nWe stayed there 26th March - 3rd April and enjoyed a very welcoming reception. Arriving an hour before check in, we were kindly offered lunch (an unexpected but welcome gift) and had a warm welcome. The food here is fresh, varied and plentiful. The bread is replenished every mealtime with fresh baguettes and loaves of different varieties. On the menu over the 8 days was a variety of meats and fish; chicken, beef, pork, veal, lamb, rabbit, salmon, perch. Grilled meats, authentic Greek cuisine, and so much salad. Lots of vegetarian options. Plentiful fresh and healthy breakfast options. Staff were attentive and very friendly- I do not know who the previous reviewer is talking about; did they really stay at the same hotel we did? Rooms were clean and maintained daily. When our daughter was unwell during the night we were given assistance from the night porter with clean bedding and no issues. \nPool and bar clean (we saw the pool being cleaned regularly) and the all inclusive drinks were limited to two at a time, but with no limit on how often you could return. This is just responsible bartendering! \nI would certainly recommend this hotel for its excellent value, location, food and staff. Easy walk to the town. Nearby play area also. Our girls aged 4 and 8 will miss you all very much, particularly one waitress who always made efforts to engage with us called Ina. Thank you Castellum Suites - we hope to see you again!",

      "text": "First off when they say all inclusive, it’s not… Food is served at certain times and only a select few drinks are offered (on the menu, the drinks with a checkmark are the only drinks included with the all inclusive). The drinks are not strong whatsoever, it’s like having juice. Throughout our stay we were regular spending money on food from outside as the food here was inedible. Staff is clearly not trained in how to handle any of your concerns. They serve with no smile and extremely rude behaviour. However, Voula is the only staff member that deserves a pay raise. She always served us with a smile and such positive attitude making our experience a little bit enjoyable.\n\nNow for the rooms. There are ants everywhere. Your room, the hallways, the pool, the restaurant, literally everywhere. Also, the room comes with one water bottle but throughout your stay you will not get another one from room service. The room service don’t change your bedsheets as-well.\n\nOne of my friend left a review during our stay and the rude staff member literally asked her why she would leave such a review, instead of simply saying that we are sorry for all the issues you faced how can we make ur current stay better or improve it for the future.",

      "text": "I’m really disappointed with my stay here at Castellum Suites. We arrived at 9:30pm and the staff were not willing to serve any food to us as dinner ended at 9pm. They could see that we were exhausted from our travels and did not help us at all. The receptionist didn’t give us any information about where are room were or where any of the facilities were.\n\n The food served at the hotel is not nice and of poor standard. It’s very repetitive and disappointing. I would recommend going out to eat for food. \n\nWe are limited to two drinks at the bar and the bartender did not like us going to the bar every 30 minutes as drinks were so watered down. You feel uncomfortable going up to the bar and asking for a drink because of the way staff act.\n\nThe walls are very thin and you can hear everyone in the hall late at night. The walls are so thin that even if you are laughing in your room you will get a noise complaint.  The staff member was very aggressive when he was telling us to ‘keep the noise down’ even though we weren’t making much noise. The issue was the building has been made poorly so everyone can hear people in the rooms next to them.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is we came to Rhodes to relax and it turned into a nightmare as soon as we checked in. \n\nThe staff aren’t friendly and overall our stay was not great. I regret staying at this hotel and paying so much money as we felt so unwelcome and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",
