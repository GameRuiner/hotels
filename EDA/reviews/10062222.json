The staff are amazing and very friendly especially Simo, who could not do enough for us. Even hauling our suitcases to Main Street to get us a taxi when the one we booked did not turn up.\nHotel is in a lovely quiet area but very central to everything. \nThe rooftop pool and bar are a lovely addition .\nDefinitely deserves the great reviews and will be back ðŸ˜Š",

Our room was spacious and very comfortable, the rooftop swimming pool was lovely (if a little bracing at this time of year), breakfast was great - lots of choice, omelet station, array of bread, cereal, cheese and meat, mini bar was reasonably priced, as was the rooftop bar and everywhere was spotlessly clean. \n\nThe best feature however were the staff. The reception team were great - Adrian was so helpful and polite, Simo provided great recommendations on where to go and restaurants to try and Aida was  so accommodating and professional. All the staff that we met were lovely from the breakfast team, the bar staff and the housekeeper. We would definitely stay again.",

The staff are excellent from the reception to the  breakfast staff to the room servicing. It is clean and very comfortable. The breakfast is excellent. The pool on the roof and the outside seating there are great with a fantastic view of the cathedral. The location of the Hotel Catalonia is great once one has figured out the shortest route to the Placa de Catalunya by the narrow streets. I recommend it strongly.",
