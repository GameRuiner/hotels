We took one elevator then had a walk past the dining room to another elevator before reaching the floor our room was on. We did have a nice view to the Placa Catalunya. The roof top pool looked lovely but it was far too cold when we were there in March but beautiful views over Barcelona. Many restaurants close by.",
