      "text": "Nothing works, not even speaking a decent English to the guy at the reception.\nAircon is either on or off, no way you can use the thermostat. Bathroom smells like sewer. \nBreakfast: there are no cups for coffee.\nGood luck with meals overall.\nItâ€™s cheap. Thatâ€™s what you get.\nHere and there you find nice personnel, like Mahmoud at that pool bar, but heâ€™s an exception.\nThis resort really sucks.\nDonâ€™t go unless youâ€™re on a budget like I was in that case.",

      "text": "Basically this hotel is useless , first :\n *  food is 1/10 \n*  They gave us 1 Towel and we were 2 guests in a Double room which is WEIRD \n* we call the reception more than 5 time in 3 hours to get us Towels and they didnâ€™t !! \n* Room is very Dirty \n*  in the bathroom you canâ€™t take a clean shower since they didnâ€™t gave you shampoo or any shower giel to wash your body which is weird \n* In the room you can find the Water heating jug  ( electric Kattle ) but they dont gave you any Tea , coffee or even WATER to use it! Is that normal? I mean you call yourself 4 stars you donâ€™t deserve 2 stars evenðŸ˜€\n* reception they are not responsible for the flight reservations so the BUS that supposed to wait us in our flight day he choice to leave us in the Hotel and leave for us a message that they called us and no one answered which is fake Flace and not true they did nothingðŸ˜€ they just skip us and told us to take a taxi instead of waiting them!  we were 3 persons .. \n* in Tivoli aqua Park there a disco part of the hotel (inside ) \nThe security told us if we want to join we have to pay 15$ and this is SCAM because the disco is for free  For the visitor at the hotel ..\n* Water was yelloOOw ðŸ¤“\n* zero appreciation for any worker there they were very disrespectful and not matured even instead of helping us they just chose to scam us !! \n* electricity and the AC not  good .\n* Rooms arenâ€™t prepared was to sleep in  ! \nSorry if I disappointed you but thats out experience and we will never come back for sure for this useless HOTEL",
