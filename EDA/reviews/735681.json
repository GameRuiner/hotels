Our room was dirty when we first got there. Had to ask the staff to clean again. The wi-fi is only available in the reception, not in the rooms. \nThe pools where quite cold and dirty. You have to get angry at people trying to sell things to be left alone by the pool. Whatever you do, do not go on the ¬´atv-safari¬ª they are pushing on you. Terrible experience. The diving and snorkling trip they are selling at the hotel was ok. But expect a lot of waiting. We had to wait 2 hours by the boats before anything happened.",
