      "text": "Stayed 4 nights in a Superior room on 3rd floor overlooking the main road. We loved the hotel decor, terrace and library room.  As other reviewers have said, the hotel is ideally located with the metro (L2/L4) nearby, the train station (Passeig de Gràcia) to and from the airport and the Plaça de Catalunya where the City Tour Buses depart, are both a short walk away. Also nearby are two Anton Gaudí buildings and  Ciutat Comtal, probably one of the best tapas bars in Barcelona.  Breakfast is a mix of hot and cold, if we had one niggle it would be that the coffee machine doesn't make great coffee.  That said, you can use the machine throughout the day.  In summary, lovely hotel, helpful staff, great location would definitely stay again. Tip of the day, use the Lidl next door to hotel for bottled water, drinks and snacks, and get a Hola Barcelona Travel Card.",

      "text": "Large rooms, high ceilings, elegant decoration. Rooms facing Gran Via get noise from street traffic. Not for light sleepers. Rooms in back of hotel looking over the terrace are quiet. Only issue is the noise of flushing water in pipes when neighboring guests turn on and off water in bathroom (e.g. sink, shower). Very loud to the point that it would wake me up in morning. We reported this and reception confirmed other guests complained but they could not solve it yet. Other issue is smell of cooked food that sometimes came in from vents and when we opened the windows (on back side). Nice and comfortable library where you can work. Spacious breakfast room with sufficient food variety; pity for the coffee: only one Nestlè commercial coffee machine, long waiting time and whatever you chose (cappuccino, americano, espresso, etc.) looked and tasted the same and was not good. Please change it. Personnel proactive and helpful, always with a smile.",
