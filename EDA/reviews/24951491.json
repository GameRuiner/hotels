This hotel was perfect for our visit. Very central to all of Dubai's top attractions, had its own beach, 2 swimming pools and our room was just fabulous with a perfect view across the bay. The staff were great and were exceptional in looking after us during our stay. The food at breakfast was everything you could think of and more. Also there are two funky and lively bars at the beach entrance so we had to indulge in a few drinks at night. Situated on West Beach Promenade meant we could walk freely up and down the Palm to see all the beach bars and restaurants on offer or just go for a leisurely stroll. All in all a great hotel that we would recommend to all visiting Dubai. ",
