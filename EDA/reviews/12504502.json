      "text": "This was a very nice hotel located in a great area. I stayed there for 5 nights. Gabriel greeted us and was very nice, pleasant and helpful. Maria and the door guys were very courteous as well. The reason I gave this a 3 star rating is because the hotel information says DAILY housekeeping but if I didn’t go to the front desk to ask for housekeeping service my room  would NOT get cleaned. I stayed in a suite which is higher  in price than the normal rooms. I was assuming the housekeeping would be done without me having to request it DAILY (which I really hated to do) One of the young ladies at the front desk named Julia was NOT plesant  or friendly to deal with and whenever I would tell her that my room needed cleaning  (after the entire day of waiting for houskeeping service) she would not do a thing about it and would just give me a look like she did not care and wanted me to leave. I had told her that I needed towels one day and did she NOT do a thing to get them for me.  I had to BEG her for my room to get cleaned. I  really feel that she needs more training in dealing with people and customers service. The 5 night I was there she was never friendly or helpful. Thank you Gabriel, Maria and the guys at the front desk for your plesant, helpful and friendly attitude. You guys are the best MINUS Julia.",

      "text": "Great location!  Great location!  Great location!  We had a really spacious room and so did our other companions, who had a great balcony.  Unfortunately, the other couple with us (who paid for the same Superior Room accommodation) had a much smaller room than ours.  We liked the two doormen who were very personable and Milbert at the Front Desk was very helpful.  Pepe, however, was a little terse in his manner with us and rather than trying to be helpful, he had a brusque way about him that was not very customer-friendly.  \n\nThe breakfast was okay, but when we asked if there was a drinking glass for water and a drinking glass for orange juice, we were told we used the one glass for both.   When we were hanging out @the dining room after breakfast while waiting for our chauffer to take us to the airport on our last day, one of our companions used one of the drinking glasses on the table for water, the waiter came up to us to tell us that we were not to use any of the items on the table as they were set for breakfast only.  Overall, though, our stay was fine, especially on our last night when we went to the wonderful balcony of one of our companions' rooms and had a nice nightcap.  Like I said, great location!  ",
