      "text": "We stayed here as a family to visit Ephesus. Hotel check-in was easy and quick. The lobby was clean and stylish, with a spa-like diffuser somewhere, giving off a nice inviting scent. We booked a family room with two separate bedroom areas and two en-suite bathrooms. Perfect amount of space with a small balcony. Since the weather was transitional between cold and cool, the heat was on, making our rooms a bit warm (centrally controlled air). We had to open the door to the balcony a few times through the night, fighting the constant smell of cigarette smoke outside, to cool off a room to make it more comfortable. Our room faced the road, so it was quite noisy well into the night. Many cars had loud speakers with political mumbo jumbo, ahead of the future election. Beds were rock hard but the hotel did have a menu of pillows. I asked for some different ones, but the staff just brought up some random pillows, so I’m not sure if the pillow menu is really a thing. Staff at the front desk was quiet but nice, but the dining room staff was much nicer and accommodating. Breakfast was great! Lots to pick from but I highly recommend the flaky croissant-like balls local to Izmir, the check board brown/cream semi-sweet bars, and the wettest fudgy cake I’ve ever eaten!!! We loved breakfast! \nAlso important to note, the hotel is in a fantastic area for walking. We walked to the bazaar, the pier, and to a restaurant around the corner. Lots of restaurants to pick from! Great value for the money, satisfying breakfast, walkability, but overall, we didn’t feel rested after we left with the hard beds, smoky air from outside, and loud environment.",

We are also pleased that you enjoyed our breakfast. It is always appreciated to have positive comments from our guests.\n\nWe are truly sorry to hear for the issue you've experienced with air-conditioning, cigarette smoke and noise from outside. Our air -conditioning system is central controlled as you've said but you may turn it off whenever needed. Our hotel's beds are orthopedic and there are extra mattress pads on them to make them soften but sometimes this may not well enough to meet the expectations. We hope that if you choose to stay with us again in the future, we can work towards earning a higher rating from you and we would offer you a room at non-smoking floor to avoid any smoke from outside. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we look forward to serving you better on your next visit.\n",
