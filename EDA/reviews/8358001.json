      "text": "Day 1, 8th February 2024: \nUpon arrival at the hotel, I had booked a double room and requested a quiet location away from the lift, as is my custom. However, the initial room assigned to me had a noisy Aircon, reminiscent of a helicopter. Despite a technician's attempt to resolve the issue, it persisted, leading to a relocation to another floor. Unfortunately, this room also overlooked the lift, contrary to my initial request. Another wait ensued as we hoped for a suitable room allocation, but the ordeal was far from over. \n\nThe newly allocated room had a bed that appeared to be a double but was, in fact, two twin beds pushed together. We returned to the manager and requested a mattress change to eliminate the gap between the beds, to which the manager agreed. However, upon returning to the room later that night, we discovered that no action had been taken. \n\nDay 2: \nIn the morning, we once again requested the manager to change the mattress. However, he informed us that changing the mattress would require changing rooms again. Frustrated with the ongoing issues, we decided to leave for the day and signalled for the room to be cleaned by placing the blue light outside. Upon our return at night, we were shocked to find the room untouched and the cleaning staff seemingly unaware. \n\nAngered by the poor service, we called the manager, who deflected responsibility to housekeeping. Growing increasingly furious, I demanded to speak with the GM, only to learn that the GM had already left for the night, as it was Friday. Left with no choice, the manager and the housekeeping manager reluctantly came to our room to apologize and offered yet another room change, this time with a true double bed. \n\nWith no alternative, we reluctantly began packing our bags to relocate to another room. Despite the challenges, the manager, Mr. Ajay remained steadfastly proud of his efforts with no empathy to our suffering. I demanded a refund for at least one night's stay to hold the hotel accountable and compensate for our inconvenience which was meant to prompt a change in their behaviour through a financial consequence, but the manager adamantly declined.\n\nI will be checking out tomorrow, the 11th. To anyone reading, I strongly advise against staying at this hotel. It is a complete waste of money, as it clearly lacks a focus on quality or customer satisfaction. The only they have is their location.\n\n",
