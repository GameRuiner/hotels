      "text": "Really great hotel, the staff are very helpful and friendly. They will try to accommodate any request. The room was big and clean and sunny. I was at first put in a smokers room, but then they changed me to a really nice clean room. Make sure you request a non smoking room if you don't smoke. This is a great hotel and great location right near busmane. There is some traffic noise, but not too bad - normal for the middle of a city. I would definitely stay here again. The staff do everything they can to help and make you feel at home.",

      "text": "I stayed here with my family August 2014. We have been holidaying in Marmaris for 7 years now and stayed 10 different hotel and apartments but this is by far the worst. \nOn arrival we noticed that the doors and windows had signs of forced entry. The sink had a crack in it and the shower doors almost fell apart when you closed them. The apartment was designed to sleep up to 4 people however only 1 glass and no spoons available. The door to the balcony was broken and would not lock or close and would open in the wind.\nIf buying food and drink from the hotel bar do not make the mistake we did and run up tab. We had 3 days to pay and when I asked for the bill they presented me with bills I had paid 2 days prior however I had taken photos of those bills at the time of payment and when I presented them the time dated photos they looked shocked and immediately reduced the bill but there was still items of drink and food we had not even had. If you have a safe deposit box dont expect to get your cash out without waiting because out of the numerous times we went to get cash out only 3 times the reception was open and had to go looking for the reception manager. The room does have a tv which would be great if the only English speaking channel had reception but yes you have guessed it didnt. My daughter discovered 3 cockroachs in her room. If you dont eat and drink in the hotel every day the staff dont want to know you and you will sit for a considerable amount of time before they come to take your drinks order.\nTo summarise we will never book this hotel again as there are many other cheap hotels which are clean with good freindly honest service.",

The location was great - right opposite the main train station and there were plenty of restaurants opened til' late. Just a street behind is a local area where we found freshly squeezed juice for 1TL! The best thing about this hotel though was probably the friendliness of the hotel manager. Although he spoke little English, he did his best to help me with my queries for which I'm nothing but grateful. The room was very big and given the price this was excellent value. \n\nThe downside, however, is that there was a shortage of plugs in the room (only 1!), and also the bathroom can get quite easily wet and flooded. Can be easily overlooked given the price, hospitality, and location though!",
