It's a small hotel hidden away from the main streets and we were left really impressed at the quality of the decor, furnishings and the small little details in the room, the staff mentioned that it was a newly built hotel. It's professionally run with the warmest of staff members and so close to one of the larger shopping malls and 10 mins from the airport.",
