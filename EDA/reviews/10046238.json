      "text": "This hotel is great if you want a good nights kip! Comfortable bed, fridge, kettle, good sized tv and the bathroom is very modern. There is also a safe in the LONG wardrobes which was great! The decor in rooms was just a bit dull (dark wood/carpets/curtains) however im more for comfort, new, fresh and clean, and it was all of these things! Staff were extremely helpful and rooms were cleaned on request. ",
