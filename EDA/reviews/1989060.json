Good location, so easy to walk everywhere from the hotel.\nOur room was clean and spacious.\nWe had a car and the hotel has parking. \nWe liked the spa although the pool was a bit small so more of a plunge pool than one you can swim in.\nWe would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",

Urban deluxe rooms very comfortable & clean with plenty of toiletries supplied. We ate dinner in restaurant one evening & enjoyed carbonara/Greek salad.

It is a full breakfast, offering a full coffee station to customize your coffee, fruit, eggs, a selection of proteins and even mimosas. \nIt is close to several attractions and we were able to walk easily to Gothic center and up to Montjuic. Close to many restaurants and local cafe's for the days we didn't do breakfast at the hotel. They also offered us two welcome drinks from their bar.
