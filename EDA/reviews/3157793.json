Because of using the qualitative internet I had to sit on the floor and this is not good for this hotel.\n\nIf you want to pay less and spend your most time near the sea you may choose Hotel Balca.\n\nBreakfast is also typical Turkish meals which I have seen in Istanbul as well.

Absolutely love Turkish breakfasts, coffee and chai! \n\nAlsancak, Kordon is the coolest neighborhood. Right outside of the hotel in either direction are loads of wonderful restaurants, and the cutest street side cafes. There's so many it will be hard to choose where to go. \n\nShort walk to shopping and the waterfront with loads of more restaurants and cafes. Also, very conveniently located. If coming in via airport take the train straight to Alsancak station and you're about a 5min walk to the hotel! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAlso, if you're visiting on a Sunday there's a cool street side market about a block away. \n\nTe≈üekk√ºrler T√ºrkiye üáπüá∑ ",

The hotel doesn't have parking - we were able to park outside the hotel on the street overnight but had to move it early next morning.  There is parking closeby. \n\nEverything is in walking distance.  It seems a fairly safe area. We walked to the Kordon (seafront) and there are lots and lots of places to eat and drink.\n\nHotel doesn't have a lift which proved a bit of a problem as we had lots of luggage.  Breakfast was v basic Turkish - nothing special.\n\nRooms had aircon, wifi and fridge with free water.  Room was small and bathroom v small but shower was ok. However, we were only staying 1 night. \n\nRecommend for a v short stay.",
