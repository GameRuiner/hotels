      "text": "Typical Indian run hotel so don’t expect a good standard. However the room was ok and through my 2 week stay the staff on the whole were also good. The ‘manager’ however was less than cooperative when my business trip was cut short by a few days refusing to even discuss a refund. This has never happened before in the 25 years I’ve been travelling to Dubai and for that reason I will never use this hotel again.",
