      "text": "We've just returned from 10 day holiday and were sad to leave. We had a lovely room overlooking the sea (room 2103). Our cleaner Mohammed  kept the room lovely and often seen tidying around the resort, which is also spotlessly clean. At the moment there is building/renovation work taking place but this did not disturb us at all. Sadly the main pool is closed due to this. However there is an indoor pool and small outside pool. We tended to go to beach and snorkel. The beach is at the end of the resort and you go past this to avoid walking on coral reef. The fish are amazing and you can paddle to see the fantastic coral life. Lots of fossils to see too.  My son loved the Police dogs on the beach!\n\nEvery member of staff is hard working and friendly and helpful. Buffet style meals with lots of choice (we are vegetarian).  We also used the International restaurant and Chinese. \n\nThe resort has Spa and hairdresser facilities. I had 2 amazing massages booked through Fransesco. Highly recommend!\n\nThe resort is quite steep however with lots of steps. There are ramps to rooms but to get fully around resort and beach might be tricky for those with young children or health problems. I would not recommend if you need a walker or wheelchair.\n\nThe thing that needs to be seriously dealt with in all tourist resorts in Egypt and all hotels is rubbish and plastics. The resorts are spotless but outside of them are piles of rubbish. Sadly this enters the sea and corals. This is already impacting the coral reefs. I constantly collected rubbish from the sea but it's going to get out of control if not addressed. I urge Egyptian tourism, Government and people to not kill the thing that makes Egypt so special. I've been to a few places in Egypt and love it but rubbish is a major problem.\n\nWe hope to return in the future!",

      "text": "Absolutely brilliant holiday under the Egyptian sun made all the more enjoyable because of the fantastic staff at the Pyramisa, especially Mohammed Paradise and his team at the beach restaurant.\nThis trip was for 10 nights and was the latest in over a dozen holidays to all parts of Egypt over the years.\nThere is redevelopment happening but it’s not a big issue at all unless you are very picky - you will hardly hear any noise at all from it. The work has to be done sometime and will only go to make the hotel facilities even better.\nThere is a good choice of restaurants with La Speranza and Malai Mongolian being our favourites.\nThe Animation team are fabulous and are full of energy - especially Hussain and Noor who deliver a top class Aquagym every morning and are still going strong every night when the hotel hosts a range of different top class shows.\nA special mention must also go to Mohammed Ali from the on-site Oscar diving centre. He is not only a genuine nice guy but also offers some great excursions on land and sea - definitely worth finding him if you want to do a trip out for the day from the hotel.\nWe can’t wait to return to the Pyramisa and hope to be back as soon as possible to experience the warmth of the hospitality and friendliness of the hotel staff.",
