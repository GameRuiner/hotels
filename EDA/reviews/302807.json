      "text": "This was my first solo trip so was a little apprehensive. From the moment I got into the hotel I was met by friendly faces. As I had got there in the evening 9.40pm and dinner service was about to finish.  I was told to leave my cases and to go into get some dinner and I could check in after. My room was spacious, clean and comfortable. It was lovely to see bottled water in the fridge and tea and coffee was stocked well. The room was cleaned daily and the guy cleaning it was lovely and helpful and always left a lovely design with the bedding. If I saw him in the morning he would always ask if I needed anything else and always left extra water in the room for me. I had a lovely garden and sea view room 1608 and was away from entertainment so was relatively quiet. The pool area was quiet in the mornings but much busier in the afternoons as I quickly realised this was due to other travellers coming up from the beach as the sun had gone down however there were more than enough sun beds to cater for this. As a first time solo traveller I was made to feel very comfortable especially when dining. I was greeted personally each day in the dining hall by Besso (food and beverage manager),  George, Mina and was always asked if I was enjoying my meal and could they get me anything. On my last day when the wrist bands were taken off at noon, I wasn’t being picked up until 3.45pm and sat in the main reception I was approached by Besso and asked if I wanted some lunch or a drink. As I declined he insisted I have something and brought me some fruit and tea into the reception which I know he didn’t need to do this. This for me speaks volumes! I have stayed in a lot of hotels and I really couldn’t fault the staff at this hotel. I was met by smiles all week. The food was varied and plentiful. I personally loved the variety of salads with everything for everyone. I’m not a pastry  person however at breakfast there was the largest choice I have ever seen and even I was tempted!! The only downside was the amount of Russians and they can be very rude to the staff which annoyed me but I imagine this is in all around Egypt! I signed up to the 3 day Spa and enjoyed the sessions however you do need to let the receptionist know what you expect I.e. deep tissue, relaxing massage as the masseuse don’t speak English well. I did this on my 3rd occasion snd had a fab massage as requested. I also went on a day boat trip and had the best day snorkelling and diving which was magnificent and would highly recommend. The guides were great and made the day during the trip fun and everyone was included! Would definitely recommend and look forward to returning again",
