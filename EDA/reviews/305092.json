      "text": "The staff in the hotel were fantastic and couldn't do enough for you, bar staff, pool man, cleaners chefs and receptionist. The grounds are beautifully planted and tidy. The hotel is also in a great location on the beach and close to Naama bay shops and restaurants. Food is fresh and tasty but can be repeatative. Hotel is a little dated but clean. I'd definitely go back.\n\nPlaces Iâ€™d recommend to visit is Farsha Mountain cafe which is stunning on an evening. \nSoho square very relaxed no hassle, The Queen Vic pub in Soho Square. \n\nAlso Iâ€™d like to mention a taxi driver Mohammed who works outside of the hotel ( taxi number 352 )\nHe was very polite, reasonable and when we booked him, he was always prompt and reliable.",

Due to bereavement, I now go on my own, itâ€™s nice that long standing hotel staff remember my visits with my husband which makes me feel safe and comfortable.\nRooms are a bit dated but are very clean, beds are comfortable and linen is regularly changed and staff always respond to any issues. I prefer to eat my evening meal in Pirates bar where there is a good menu and cooked to order. This bar has a good atmosphere, regular evening entertainment and great staff.\nThe beach is probably the biggest and best in Naama Bay, lots of umbrellas and sunbeds, however at busy times and the selfishness of some  guests, finding a sun bed can be a bit of a challenge but the beach staff work hard to find them. The beach clears at lunchtime, when all inclusive guests go to lunch, so the afternoons are lovely and peaceful with lots of available sunbeds. The usual annoyance of people putting towels on sunbeds early in the morning and not appearing until hours laterðŸ˜¡\nAll in all, although parts of this is hotel does need a bit of an upgrade and toilets on or near the beach, itâ€™s very clean, welcoming and staff are polite, very helpful and will do all they can to resolve any issues.\nI love this hotel and will keep returning.",
