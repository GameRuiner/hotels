Samy, Mohammed, Ahmed, Shif, thank you a lot for a help. If you need something, just ask managers on the reception. At hotel they helped me with transfer to airport, booking excursion and exchange money. At the shop near reception you can buy nice magnets and small bags - cheaper than on old bazaar.\n\nVery nice geolocation. Near 2 big supermarkets, one of them 24/7. From old bazzar to hotel Aida - 15 minutes by foot.\n\nI recommend!",
