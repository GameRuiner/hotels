      "text": "1.\tCheck-in/Check-out: 4/5\nCan be more efficient especially for HH lane. Other guests were attended to faster at times than HH lane.\n\n2.\tRooms (cleanliness, amenities) 5/5\nNo comments, good, clean rooms.\n\n3.\tOn-premise restaurants: 5/5\nWe really liked the BBQ restaurant on premises. Whoever made it work definitely lived in the States. From food to drinks to the atmosphere, it was a place we would definitely come back to.\n\n4.\tPool area: 5/5\nVery nice pool (There is a beach but with all the yachts and the boats you can literally see oil on the surface of the water).\nYou can also order drinks and food and it will be brought to you. Can stay here the whole day.\n\n5.\tService: 5/5\nThis could have been 2 or 3 if it was not for one person at this hotel. Kudos to Assistant Manager Monica M. My wife and I had encountered a less than pleasant experience at the lounge upstairs which put a sour note one of the evenings. Neither the concierge on the shift nor the food and bev manager did anything when the situation was brought to their attention. When I spoke to Monica, however, I can certainly say that this Hilton is lucky to have her. She listened and listened and then put a cherry on top for our stay (which she did not have to). I was providing feedback not to get anything in return.\n\t\nNote: The breakfast area does remind me of Brownian motion with everyone trying to navigate their way to whatever item. The layout is somewhat strange.\n\nOverall weighted score: 4.96 out of 5.0\n\nWould we come back? Yes",

      "text": "Excellent hotel, clean, food good. The only negative was I had paid extra for club lounge access to he told at check in that under 18 were not permitted in the lounge for happy hr 5-7pm. I have a 13 yr old. We were told it was new rules. We asked for a refund on club lounge access and it was refused as we had already paid. I feel this was unfair as the rules had changed since booking as I would not have paid extra for club lounge access when booking. I feel we could have been offered vouchers to use at restaurants if no refund. The afternoon tea was also disappointing.",

Room upgrade on arrival, staff who are incredibly helpful,  attentive and accommodating, a great selection of restaurants and bars - there is something for everyone! The rooms are also very comfortable.\n\nAt breakfast each morning we were served by a lovely guy (Gautham) who was always friendly and jolly. Nothing we asked was ever too much.
