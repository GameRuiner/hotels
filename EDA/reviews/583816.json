      "text": "This was our third visit to Nirvana Cosmopolitan. \nWe’ve visited Antalya many times and this hotel is the best. We love everything about this hotel. The rooms are great and spacious, the food is brilliant for AI . \nThe Buffet - is very hygienic , all serving staff with gloves and hats. This for me is a must. I much prefer this over all the counters being open and helping yourself. Serat, had the best customer service , he helped us get a table every evening as we were two families and tried to sit together where possible. Serat always made this possible for us. \nFellinis - we had breakfast every day in fellinis my children loved it. We also ate here on many occasions for lunch and dinner and even late night if the children wanted a snack (supper) before bed. The staff are great they can’t do enough for you. Even when guests are rude (I didn’t like to see this as I think it’s uncalled for). Hanife, and many others in this restaurant work so hard and always serve you with a smile. \n\nThe outside pools and the indoor pool were great. We also used the indoor pool and jacuzzi too. My children loved the water park. \n\nThe service in this hotel is impeccable and the staff here are a credit to the hotel. The cleans, waiters/waitresses, animation team really do go above and beyond. This is why we choose this hotel time and again and always recommend to family and friends too. \n\nThe only thing I could suggest would be in early august when we came the entertainment wasn’t as good as it was in 2022. We still enjoyed it, but previously it was much better as this time we left a couple of times after 10/15 minutes. This isn’t a complaint though and definitely can’t wait to visit again this year.",

But I would especially like to mention the animation team.  Because they did everything they could to make this holiday a good one.. They won't be here after tomorrow.  Because they're leaving their jobs.  The hotel's decision. And this decision is really bad. Because it's ridiculous that they let these people go when the hotel is so boring and they are working hard.. When we booked this hotel, we saw how strong the entertainment and activities were and decided accordingly.  Now all that's left is live music..I regret choosing this hotel in the winter season, but thank you to the staff",

ALEXANDRA is a diamond in the nirvana crown an absolute lovely person inside and out. MY WHATSAPP  CONSIERGE WAS HASSAN and once more can not be more thankful for all great time and help . \nThe hotel itself is lovely and clean and very safe. I can honestly say we'll return .\nStaff overall are so professional  ,in the main restaurant and VICTORIA  in the excel bar.\nNow the other staff at the excel bar are just great and helpful and most of all friendly and chatty, I can pronounce their names but can't spell them😂\nAlso the bar staff down at the aqua bar. Great service and also chatty and friendly another pic provided.\nThe cleaning staff also deserve a mention, they do not stop, the place is in great condition and that comment also applies to the housemaids , rooms done superbly on a daily basis.FOOD IS TOP QUALITY !\nOne last person to mention.
