The rooms are large, transparent and nicely decorated. the best trips and discounts are at Jamal's on the beach, you can also learn a lot about their religion and other interesting things from him. The food is good, the soups are the best. The animators are also funny and always communicate, even if they don't know the language. Overall, we rate the entire trip as excellent, you can relax, those who want to take part in the attractions, those who don't, don't, everyone is satisfied. We recommend it to everyone, we will definitely come back here.",

He is always smiling and helping out where he can. Bringing drinks to us when he is busy! He is a credit to the hotel!!!\n\nWe will return here!\n\nThanks 😊",

I only book bed and breakfast as I arrive late evening, but the complimentary supper delivered to the room is a nice bonus. The room I had was on the outside of the hotel so did not have the best of views, but it did not matter as I was only staying overnight. The room had a nice large bed and good air con and I had a good night's sleep. As the restaurant area was being refurbished, breakfast was served in another area and was a very nice buffet and a bonus as it was self serve unlike on previous visits. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. I spent a couple of hours round the pool in the morning, and it was very relaxing, although the pool I sat by was not heated so was very cold. Overall great value and will return in October on next trip to Sharm.",
