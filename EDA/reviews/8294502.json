Metro is 200 yards away and the area is well served with tapas and tavernas.\n\nThe room is nicely appointed and very clean and comfortable.\n\nBreakfast is simple yet delicious and buffet style so plenty of choice and lots to go round.\n\nLovely service - I highly recommend this wonderful hotel.",

There was a very small honour bar with beer, wine and Scotch.  The breakfast buffet offered various types of food to satisfy a lot of different tastes.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and supportive.\n\nThe location is excellent to visit many sites which are in reasonable walking distance.\n\nI would stay there again.",

Only a short taxi ride from the airport, close to the Gothic quarter and the main shopping area, La Rambla.

About 15 minute walk to La Rambla and very close to Playa Cataluna , where the buses stop and close to the metro station. Would definitely recommend ",
