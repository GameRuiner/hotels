      "text": "March 2024. Everything was very good. Was with my 8 yo boy. Some minor inconveniences but nothing extraordinary for Egypt. Staff was friendly or neutral what was a big + for us. The only disadvantage-the pool was not heated or if it was,we did not noticed the difference sea-pool. After reading many negative reviews I was worried but-no stress, everything here is fine. Spent many hours outside the room that was just normal room. In the center of Soho is a pharmacy with national prices, not the one in front of the hotel. Also in Soho you will find delicious popcorn,my boy asked every evening. For taxis asked to use the meter.  Supermaket in front not the best, did not buy their goods. Not far from the airport. Beach was opened after the sunrise, jetty was closed until 8. The beach was fine if loud music is OK. We are happy with our vacation in Island view but next time we will go to our loved Hadaba region, more peace there.",

The all-inclusive version is a must-have with local alcohol, drinks, great beer and juices. Coral reef next to the hotel. deckchairs, beach towels. The hotel zone is guarded and fenced. friendly and helpful staff. We had no worries about sending our 10-year-old son to the bar for a juice.

The rooms need to be renovated.\n2. Lack of Wi-Fi throughout the territory.\n3. Overly clingy restaurant staff.",
