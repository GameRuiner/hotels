      "text": "It is with great regret that i write to express my utter disappoinent and disgust in the manner with which i was treated at Lavender hotel & apartment located in Al nanda 1, Dubai.\nMyself and my fiancee checked in the evening of the 24th of August and attended to by a gentleman named Ahmed i believe.\nAhmed's demeanor was extremely unwelcoming and cold from the onset. Perhaps he was having a bad day, but no excuses , if you work in the front of desk hospitaitlity industry you have to bring your A game as was not the case .\nA business acquittance decided to pop in to discuss with me briefly but was met with hostility by both Ahmed and the security personnel who would  not allow him to come up to my hotel room.\nI went downstairs to meet my colleague at which point Ahmed was unapologetically insisting that it was a Police rule that guests could not visit a hotel occupants  room after midnight.\nWhen asked to show us the rule book or guide to support his claims, he asked us to leave  asked if we were police to be demanding such information and to follow up with the security manager in the morning.\nMyself , my companion and colleague left the premises to have a cup of tea around the corner for aleast 40mins. Upon my return with only myself and companion back to the hotel. Ahmed approached us and accused me of sneaking my colleague via the basement parking to my room.\nObviously i was  very upset with the  accusation as  i demanded to see the Video that supported his claims and also to speak to Hotel manager in the morning.\nAhmed reluctantly refused to show us  the replay of his footage and dismissed me off to bed and spoke to me as though i was a child.\nI calmly retired back to my room with my partner and sort to deal with the matter in the morning.\nNext morning of the 25th August, i approached the reception area and requested to speak to the manager  and was greeted with another extremely unhelpful male staff who refused to give me any contact telephone number for the manager or even a contact email address to log in a complaint or aleast establish the underlying factors towards this type of customer service.\nI am deeply shocked at the hospitality shown by this establishment to say the least the manner in which i was treated, disrespect and attitude portrayed by their members of staff.\nI have lived in hotels around the world and this was an all time low in their overall performance both personally and professionally.\nI give them a zero rating and strongly suggest that the entire staff are taken to boot camp customer excellence training or atleast teach staff on how to manage and talk to respectable paying customer.",

      "text": "My family stay was great at Lavender. Thanking all the staff for being professional, friendly and helpful. They allowed us an early check-in. Located in a lovely place close to West Zone supermarket which operates 24/7. Nice continental and Indian buffet breakfast available with coffee, juice and fresh fruits. Big spacious rooms with clean washrooms with hot water 24/24. Free bottle of water every day. Good WiFi everywhere. I love the swimming pool which is on the roof which is well maintained and safe for kids also. Fire security in all corners of the hotel and in every rooms. Swimming pool water is controlled every day. One thing that I still miss is their massage chair which was on our daily routine before bed after a long walking day. Fifteen minutes drive from airport and AED 32 by meter taxi. Union Metro and Al Ghurair Centre is within 15 minutes walking distance. Carrefour supermarket, Nandos, KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks and many other renowned restaurants in the centre. Many good restaurants at cheap rates also nearby and can order foods from outside to hotel or you can order from hotel as well. There's a night market nearby also selling some new and used products. You can walk safely till late night alone. You can wave any taxi anytime or hotel staff can call one for you at no cost. Tips to reach Dubai Mall Metro from Union metro is AED 14. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting in groups or family or alone also. ",
