      "text": "First of all, there are a few Susuzlus in the same Konkak district in Izmir so don't get them confused. I had booked this via booking.com the night before and paid 23GBP for a night’s stay bed and breakfast. It’s very central - very close to the main train station and in between two metro stops which lead onto the Izban and the airport. Door-to-door to the airport takes about 45 minutes. From the otogar, enough buses and dolmuses will pass the boulevard parallel. Not far to walk to the main promenade and the corniche. The bazaar is practically next door.\n\nThe hotel is very nicely decorated but in the relatively spacious room (405), there simply aren’t enough sockets. The wifi was dodgy too. As I had a room facing the main road, the traffic was noisy till mid-evening when everything had finally died down. In the tiny bathroom, the shower leaked pretty badly, too. In terms of TV, there are Arab, French, German and English channels in addition to the usual Turkish fare available. \n\nBreakfast was unexciting - hot and cold food. Lots of tea bags to steal though. \n\nRecommended for location and price (if lira is weak) but could not with a bit of an upgrade of the rooms which are a bit rough on the edges.",
