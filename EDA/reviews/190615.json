      "text": "This hotel is amazing, from the warm welcome by the front desk team to a drink while you check in. Eddie checked us in and was very knowledgeable about the city and all the places to stop by.  Although our room did not have a view of the city, it was lovely.  I found my happy place in the jetted bathtub, and this hotel pays attention to the details and provides bath salts for your bubble bath concert moment. We were given dinner recommendations by the front desk team in the evening, and 9reinas almost brought tears to my eyes about how good the food was. The breakfast team were so welcoming and made sure everyone was well looked after, and the breakfast was incredibly yummy. If you are staying in this hotel, do not miss an opportunity to use the spa. Anais has gifted hands, and I felt floating on cloud nine after my secret massage. The Mayan Suana was a treat, and I enjoyed the chromotherapy shower, which was a unique experience.",

Our bed was made up twice on one day, and there appears to be a turndown service in the evening with a chocolate. Complimentary minibar with cokes, a couple of beers and some water. The room and ensuite were kept very clean. Excellent position for all the main tourist locations and public transport. On my partner's birthday we arrived back after a long day to find a complimentary bottle of cava in the room.\n\nWe are light sleepers, and I'm pleased to report the hotel is very quiet during the night, and we slept well.\n\nThe room safe is large enough to take a 17\" laptop and easily supports multiple iPads, phones etc.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends visiting Barcelona. Well done and thank you to the team for a memorable stay.",
