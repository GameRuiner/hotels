Though washing machine was not there in our room, they provided us free washing in their washing facility. \nBreakfast choice was slightly limited. Size of the apartment is good enough for the families with kids. Apartments are quite even though being on the main street. We had nice and quiet sleep. Only small concern is Staff speaking ability in English was limited, though we managed with google translate. Very satisfied with the services and overall facility with the price it comes.
