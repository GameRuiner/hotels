It was a terrible experience, we had to leave at 12 at night despite having paid for that night. They are thieves who harass women.",

      "text": "The staff are excellent and really helpful. The hotel itself is really nice also, with a large courtyard dining area.\nMenu food was tasty “although some local desserts would have been preferred” the free buffet type breakfast was a bit disappointing and basic. “No cooked meats available, but chicken nuggets available which we found to be a strange breakfast choice”\nThe water did go off once during our 4 day visit, but the staff managed to get it back on within 1 - 2hrs.\nThe live music which is on every evening between 20:00 - 23:00 is good, however, be aware the rooms have zero soundproofing, so it would be impossible to sleep before 23:00.\nThe hotel is situated in the middle of the main Izmir Bazaar, with one entrance being next to the main fish market area, so be aware it does smell of fish accessing the hotel from one side.\n\nOur biggest dislike was smoking, which was permitted throughout the hotel, it was impossible to escape 2nd hand smoke whilst relaxing or eating in the hotel.

      "text": "Hello good morning, my name is Yuval Shaul\nUnfortunately, my experience with booking and the hotel I booked is not a good one.\nMy parents flew to Izomir in Turkey for a vacation. Their names are Hamotel and Shlomi Shaul\nI booked them LA'GORA hotel for 3 nights between the dates: 03-06/08/2023 (the reservation is in the name of my mother Hamotel Shaul)\nOn Thursday 3/8/2023 when they arrived at the hotel, they checked in. They were not in the room and went for a walk. When they came back at night and showered, there was no hot water at all but frozen water in the shower! In the morning when my father got up, he immediately ran to tell the reception about the terrible problem that it was not possible to take a shower and that it was not okay at all. And the clerks received him at the reception, understood him completely and said that unfortunately it was a malfunction in the hotel and that it is not expected to be fixed at the moment.\nMy father said he couldn't stay because of this problem, they understood him completely and told him to talk to Booking, and that they take responsibility for the problem, and that he should talk to Booking, who will send a request to cancel the cancellation, and the hotel will approve the cancellation even without a fine! Because they take responsibility for the malfunction of the hot water and understand that a guest cannot stay with such a malfunction.\nMy parents called me that morning from the reception because I made the reservation for them through you. I called you at 9:00 and spoke with a representative named Tomer. He understood the situation and called the hotel and asked them to confirm the cancellation he sent. He will confirm the cancellation.\nSo, I told my parents to leave the hotel so as not to waste their time and go to another hotel that we closed at that moment so that they could continue the trip, and mainly because the officials stated that it would be a shame to wait because the cancellation from the hotel takes 3-5 days.\nOn Saturday 8/5/2023 I received a booking email from you to the phone at this address that I sent this email to.\n\nAn email stating that the hotel claims that we did not check in at the hotel and do we confirm this statement\nOf course I mentioned that they were at the hotel and had checked in.\nAt that moment I sent an email to the hotel, asking why they don't confirm the cancellation as they said and point out that we didn't do it, of course they didn't respond to my email.\n\nYesterday, at noon, I spoke again with a representative named Majda who was lovely and understood the case and said she would help as much as possible and talked to the hotel and said she refuses to verify that he did yes he checked no and asked for proof that they were at the hotel.\n\nHe is from France, they took pictures from the hotel and even took pictures from inside their room!! So how does the hotel say they did not check in?? Please prove it to them with these pictures. In addition, because the clerks at the reception spoke English at a level that could be understood, but only Turkish, they even translated with Google Translate for my parents how to cancel the order, which also includes photos of the translation they wrote on their phone (the clerks'). There are even screenshots from the family WhatsApp group that Ray sent there messages that they are in the hotel, in the room. So you have all the evidence to solve this matter against a lying hotel!\nOne day and you won't solve this matter with hotels, I will go online to all media not to order through Booking because they do not properly represent the customer!! I found that I ordered through Booking, I ordered on the best website there is, and in this case I don't feel that way.\n\nPlease let me know how you solve this case",
