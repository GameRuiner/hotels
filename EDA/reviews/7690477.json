      "text": "The Cotton House Hotel was a favorite of ours on our recent trip to Spain. My husband and I debated between The Cotton House or Hotel Artes and ultimately decided on The Cotton House , despite the fact that the rooms are more ‘boutique’ in style, or small or European in size. We were traveling originally with 3 of our daughters so we booked 3 rooms - one on Marriott points. Our daughters had The Panama room - two twin beds overlooking the courtyard. These rooms are not big by US standards & are pricey- upwards of $500^ per night for the basic room. Our girls were cozy. We saw Americans in the lobby griping about the size of the rooms & frankly it was embarrassing- do your homework. This place is special & lovely. But it’s a European boutique hotel. We were luckily upgraded to The Vichy Suite - a bi level suite with two floors and a beautiful terrace that looks out to Gran Via to Sagrada Familia in the distance. The Cotton House is located in a great location; it’s safe by US standards and you can walk to La Rambla , ( which we don’t care for but our girls do ), and Gotic Quarter within ten minutes or hire a car in seconds. Barcelona Sants is about twenty minutes away and we came from there after our train arrived from Malaga. The BCN International Airport is about 25 minutes away. Upon arrival we were met with a great cava in Waterford crystal & water while we waited in the white beautiful lobby adorned with cotton and white leather to get our room keys. Alejandro then showed us the hotel and had our luggage delivered to our rooms & offered to make any reservations we needed; bring us more espresso pods for our in room espresso maker; ice buckets; or whatever we needed. The hotel has an in house atelier for an ‘experience’ of tailoring, because why not have a custom made shirt made from this historic property where cotton was once made? Each room is beautiful and the stair case is beautiful with marble. We had twice daily maid service with turndown service and the toiletries are special. We dined on property for dinner; dessert and the breakfast both at the restaurant and in our suite; highly recommend for dinner- make a reservation & ask for D’Mitre.",

The restaurant and patio are such great spaces with good food and drink.  The other sitting area are two rooms called the library, like an old formal living room but in cool historical building.   Also the rooftop outdoor space is nice but small.  Rooms and beds are also top notch.  Small balcony overlooking the courtyard if you are lucky.   We definitely would stay again!",
