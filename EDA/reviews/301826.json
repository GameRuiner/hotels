Restaurant staff to name a few Mohammed (drinks), Sheriff looked after us, as majority of us were vegetarian. Two Al A carte restaurants Lebanese and Ligolini Italian highly recommended. Entertainment team were excellent. Beach is excellent.\nJust a few suggestions, walking area (tiles) were slippery, especially when wet, may be put some rubber mats. Food should be labelled clearly ( some said vegetarian), but when asked they had fish or chicken stock. Bathroom a bit dated, just needs upgrading. We would definitely go back to resort.",
