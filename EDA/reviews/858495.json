      "text": "Lovely welcome in the early hours of the morning, family room with sea view on the 19th floor was beautiful; very clean and spacious with everything that you could need. The lifts as others mentioned are a slight issue..with only 3 for so many floors then you can be in for a wait. My daughter uses a wheelchair so the stairs werenâ€™t an option for us but nobody seemed to be using them even for just one floor. \n\nWe went half board and food was always delicious both in the Horizon buffet restaurant and also the others (the Japanese was our favourite and Rajnit was a real standout waitress). The pool was good fun and the lifeguards always helped to find a sun lounger which was a nice touch. \n\nLocation of hotel was perfect and beach access was really handy. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay in Dubai!",

      "text": "This hotel is absolutely amazing! We are a family of 4 and our little boy who is 6 and has autism is absolutely loving his stay and so are we. Because he is very fuzzy with food all the chefs at the Horizon have kindly made special meals for him I.e chicken nuggets and plain noodles. Thank you so much!The serving staff at the Horizon have been brilliant catering for our every need. A special shot out to Troy who went out of his way to find me some chamomile tea for this tired mum. The people at the entrance and the valets are nicest people ever and they are always not only asking us if we need anything but also going out of their way to interact with out boy to the point that he wants to take photos of them. We have been so well looked after and this is just day 3! Super inclusive hotel. Highly recommended! Amazing staff with amazing hearts! Last shout out to Maureen at Flippers for looking after our boy. We were able to finally have 40 min quality time because he was so happy there without his parents there. Flippers is the kids club.\nTheir gym is pretty cool too!",

      "text": "Returned home yesterday, 2nd April. Stayed for 7 nights and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we absolutely loved the hotel.  Our room was superb, in fact it was massive and came with all the usual things you would expect from a top notch hotel.   Our room had a full sea view which looked directly at the Ain on Bluewater Island.  Horizon buffet restaurant was beautiful although we only eat in there for breakfast.  We were all inclusive which included a Dine Around Package so we could eat in the other 3 restaurants in the hotel.  All 3 were fabulous.  Can't pick a favourite as they were all great !\n\nStaff at the hotel cannot do enough for you.   Don't be afraid to ask for anything as they'll sort it for you.  Nothing is too much trouble.   We enjoyed some wonderful conversations with Saw from the Italian bar.  Such a really nice guy from Burma and will go out of his way to make your stay such a good one.  Thank you Saw !!!    Thanks to Soji and Hassan from the pool bar.  Same again, nothing is too much trouble, ask and  you'll get it.    Thanks to the lifeguard from India (can't remember his name).. Took time out to come and chat to us on several occasions.\n\nHeatfelt thank you's to each and every one at the Amwaj Rotana, you made our holiday to Dubai an amazing one ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°",

Conveniently situated, it offers easy access to the beach, merely a five-minute walk away. Despite its many merits, we did encounter minor inconveniences such as missing towels and unattended water replenishment. However, these issues were promptly addressed with a simple call to reception, showcasing the efficiency and responsiveness of the staff. Speaking of whom, the hotel personnel are exceedingly hospitable and accommodating. The experience was occasionally marred by the behaviour of certain guests, whose rude demeanour towards both fellow patrons and staff members occasionally detracted from an otherwise excellent stay.",
