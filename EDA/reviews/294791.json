      "text": "It seems like the enchantment and quality that Marina Vista Hotel once held for me are unfortunately fading away. I want to share my recent experience to inform fellow travelers about the changing state of the hotel.\n\nFirstly, the overall condition of the hotel is not as impressive as it used to be. The architecture and decor appear to have moved away from the former splendor and elegance. Rooms lack the previous meticulous maintenance and cleanliness.\n\nThe staff didn't exhibit the warmth and helpfulness I experienced during my previous visits. I struggled to get responses to my requests in some instances, and there was a noticeable communication gap.\n\nThe facilities and services offered by the hotel were also not as appealing as before. The restaurant menu seemed to have narrowed, and the food quality didn't meet the standards set in my previous visits.\n\nIn conclusion, Marina Vista Hotel might not be experiencing its heyday anymore. Considering these changes, future guests should weigh their choices carefully.",

The pool is the winner as it’s a perfect size, is never overcrowded and the area is peaceful. The big chef restaurant serves a nice selection of meals and for the area is not overly expensive, special mention to Erdum who makes you welcome. ",
