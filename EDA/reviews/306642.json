      "text": "Fantastic two night stop over at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Dubai. Thanks to the team for making our stay as seamless and hassle free as possible. And a shout out to Ganga by the pool who - along with the rest of the team - worked tirelessly to make sure we didn't need to lift a finger. Couldn't have asked for more from across the whole staff group from housekeeping through to the guys on the door.\n\nFinally - although a corporate hotel which means you could be almost anywhere in the world - the rooms were large, clean and well stocked. And there is a fantastic breakfast spread (the French toast is a particularly highlight!) and great facilities. Highly recommend and would return. ",
