The only complaint we have was the food it‚Äôs ok if you are a big fish eater and like bones and gristle in chicken we found bones in the chicken soup and the chicken pie which put us off big time breakfast and lunch was fine so we ate out most nights after the findings of the bones all in all still a great hotel üëç",

      "text": "Here for emergency sunshine and that's exactly what we got. So early March and daily temp was between 23 and 27 degrees. Tends to have a bit of a breeze by the sea but the sun bathing areas and pool are well designed to shield you from any wind. The food here was surprisingly  excellent with an extensive buffet selection for breakfast lunch and dinner at El Sol. For variety there are other restaurants that you can book into including Gamila. Regular beach activities but if you don't want to partake that's fine and use a red flag if you don't want any sales pitches. Drinks are served on the beach including plenty of free bottled water. Our room was a basic room, it was clean, the beds were comfortable, a view of the inner courtyard and  cleaned daily.  The bathroom had an odd design with a  very narrow shower which you could not turn round in, I'm only average size and had to get out of the shower to turn round so half a wash and repeat. Evening entertainment stops about 11pm so quiet after that. All staff we met were friendly and helpful. Hotel is located near to town so easy walk into the main area of Hurghada. Overall a great early sunshine break.",

      "text": "Firstly check-in was quick greeted with a drink. We had room 611 was lovely and big balcony over looking the lagoon n sea. Room was kept spotless always topped up with water and soft drinks. The pool area was lovely and the lifeguard worked so hard keeping it clean as did the lifeguard on the beach. Hats off to them two. The beach was lovely always sun beds available. The pool area we did have to get up early to get a bed so wouldn‚Äôt want to go in peek season. The animated team were great BIG shout out to FOX n BOB lovely boys! The shows and singers were good and bad but kept us entertained.  The spa was excellent we had a Turkish bath  and a mud bath both really good and the staff were exceptional! Food was good always something there to munch on and we had a meal in the beach restaurant was lovely well worth the money.\n\nDo I think it‚Äôs a 5* no I don‚Äôt more like a 4, to many nitty gritty bits that need looking at‚Ä¶..\n\nThe drinks. Basic local spirits that were very syrupy and the cocktails wasn‚Äôt much better. So I spent the week on shandy‚Äôs which was a big disappointment! Also the constant tipping was so annoying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The trips the  luggage man on the minibus and last but not least the staff at the airport was shocking they were rude and abrupt  and it wasn‚Äôt a very nice experience! \n\nAlso the building work going on in our block I understand it has to be done but we should have been told and the hotel shouldn‚Äôt have put us directly on top of banging and drilling from 8.30am to 7pm!  Dust everywhere our room smelt of fumes. \n\nBUT it was a lovely hotel and the we had a good time!",

      "text": "Ok so as you can assume by the low star rating this hotel was most definitely not for us. It doesn't bode well when you arrive here after dropping other guests off at beautiful looking hotels and you arrive here and it looks a mess (see YouTube videos you'll see what I mean) zero kerb appeal. Booked as adults only as wanted to escape screaming kids but I'd definitely choose screaming kids over drunk adults all day long. Hotel itself and grounds nice enough but nothing that would have us wanting to return. Pool area small and struggled for sunbeds around the pool. Sunbeds on sand areas easier to get if early enough, entertainment was poor in comparison to other hotels we've stayed at throughout Egypt, food was ok nothing special but nothing particularly bad either. Positive notes were staff really do try their best, rooms nice enough and clean and weather as always in Egypt is fantastic. ",
