      "text": "On March 25, 2024, my wife, our two kids, and I came to the restaurant for buffet breakfast. A junior staff member greeted us, marked our room number, and offered a table for four. We indicated that the table was occupied by placing a round card on it. Later, when we returned from getting breakfast, we found a lady sitting at our table. Despite this, we began searching for a new table for four but couldn't find one. Eventually, we found two adjacent double tables. As we were about to sit down, a senior lady staff member (whose surname I remember as Rade, and who appeared to be of North East Indian or Nepali descent) approached my wife and instructed her not to sit at the double table, insisting that we move to a table for four outside. We explained that we could accommodate ourselves at the two double tables without joining them, showing her the round cards indicating availability on both tables. However, she rudely insisted that we could not sit there. After a brief argument, she forcefully relocated us to another table. It's unfortunate that not all employees uphold the same level of professionalism, as a few can tarnish the organization's reputation.",
