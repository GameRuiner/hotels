      "text": "This hotel is right by Kemer metro/ train station on the line from the airport and is also convenient to the other line but tricky to find the way initially. The proprietor and staff are very friendly and helpful and interested in ensuring you have a good stay. The room was small but pleasant with good facilities. Wifi is in the lobby only but works well there. Breakfast was plentiful and nice with typical Turkish fare - Borek, cold sausage, pastries, melon and cheeses. If you walk into town this will take about 20 minutes and bring you past non-tourist Izmir - including many \"clubs\" leading eventually to the Bazaar area - a must see.",
