      "text": "Good afternoon, Administration of the Land Mark Plaza Hotel!\n I have been your customer for more than 10 years and I really love your hotel because it is very convenient for me to buy my goods and it is very convenient that you have a basement for goods\n But I would like to recommend that the rooms need to be improved and updated, especially the toilet and bathtub, your hotel has been around for many years, but unfortunately there is no good repair in the washbasin, the water does not drain, the bathtub is very dirty and small, and in the restaurant there are plastic dishes and paper cups, I think, and I also need to think about this\n But in general, thank you very much for the politeness of the staff and services\n I hope to return to your hotel again",

      "text": "We had reserved the Landmark Plaza Hotel for two nights, but as soon as we entered our rooms, we realized how awful the hotel was. The building was old and didn't look like the pictures at all. Everything was rusty and stale. The furnishings looked dirty and had a strange smell. Even the toilet smelled bad and the faucet was rusty. Although it was written that the toilet had been cleaned, we doubted it. The bathtub wasn't white and was also old, and there were cockroaches on the floor, which made the night even scarier. The sheets were dirty too, with shoe marks on them. There were no rugs in the rooms except for a small one between the beds, which hadn't been swept. The staff was rude, and when we complained about our rooms, they shouted at us, making us feel unsafe. We had a terrible night, and we believe that this hotel doesn't even deserve one star. The rate should be around 2-3 because not only were the beds terrible, but the breakfast was also bad. Everything was overcooked, and it was evident that the food wasn't fresh at all. We changed hotels for the second night and asked the manager for a refund, but he ignored us and didn't help us. In conclusion, Landmark Plaza Hotel falls significantly short of even basic standards of accommodation. With subpar facilities, unhygienic conditions, and poor customer service, it is difficult to justify even a one-star rating. Prospective guests would be well-advised to seek alternative accommodations in Dubai.",
