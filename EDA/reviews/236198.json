      "text": "Room clean and comfortable, good bathroom facilities, pleasant and helpful staff are the positives. The main negative for us was that we just didn’t feel safe. The three or four flights of stairs to the hotel reception open onto Las Ramblas, which had a large population of homeless,drug addicts, beggars & thieves. As I didn’t want to chance the coffin on a chain in a cage (the lift) I navigated the unpleasant stairs to access the hotel reception. If I was alone on the stairs I felt very vulnerable to being a victim of one of the crimes that we constantly saw from our room. The 24 hour buffet was limited and edible at best. If you are British and enjoy a cooked breakfast, go elsewhere. We booked this place because my husband is diabetic and it advertises a hot breakfast. Whilst we appreciate that the Spanish idea of breakfast is very different to the British breakfast, it was nowhere near & nothing was actually served hot. A microwave was the on hand, but how do you microwave a cold boiled egg. \nThe pictures on social media are a lie and do not resemble the hotel in the slightest. I don’t want to be to negative, every person has different tastes, so I won’t mention the hotel decor. \nWe went for my husbands 6Oth Birthday, but the Las Ramblas is not a safe place to enjoy a few drinks, you constantly need to have your wits about you.",

It is kind of quirky and dated but the staff was amazing (except for one young lady working the reception desk one evening who seemed very annoyed). Our room was very small but comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was very nice. The little buffet was a nice touch for a quick bite. The always available coffee and tea was appreciated. Having free wine and beer while chatting with new friends was a highlight.",

Once you get to the first floor reception you are met by one of the great reception team who check you in quickly and arrange for you to be taken to your room.\nOur room on the first floor with a view over La Rambla and a small balcony wasn't large but was clean and comfortable. There was a full bathroom with a shower over a bath.it\nNext to the reception is the 24 hour buffet with tea, coffee machines, alcoholic and soft drinks. It's not an extensive buffet more than enough for a snack and refreshments after a day around the city.it\nAs for getting about there is a taxi tank outside the hotel entrance.\nThe hotel isn't for everyone but if you want a good location, clean comfortable rooms, complimentary food and drink and excellent helpful staff it's worth considering.\nI would definitely go there again",
