Our surprise was that you did not want to take care of it having an inappropiate behaviour and using bad words. This is just a matter of respect to our staff members and this is something we cannot tolerate.\nWe sincerely regret that this is your perspective of our staff as we work everyday to provide the best service and always looking for our guest‚Äôs comfort.\nWe send you greetings of the whole Pol & Grace team.\nJ√∫lia Colet ‚Äì Team Leader\n",

They were very friendly, very understanding of our situation. The hotel and rooms are clean and we had a very good rest. The reception is nice to work with complimentary tea and coffee. We had a dog and it could stay without any extra charge, which is not common in hotels.\n\nFriendliness goes a long way and Pol & Grace really delivers on that! Thank you!",

We travelled from the airport to the hotel via public transport and found this to be easy enough.\n\nThe staff are all lovely, a big thank you to the gent on reception who provided us with some fantastic bar recommendations and the fantastic ladies who helped us book a taxi when we required one.\n\nThe rooms are fantastic and with a real clean and modern feel, the beds are ginormous!! But very comfortable with a powerful shower in the bathroom which is always appreciated. \n\nThank you to the Pol and Grace team for making our stay so comfortable, we will be back ! üòä",

      "text": "Stayed at this hotel for around 6 nights and it was a great stay. The location is great being close to several metro/subway/bus stations (closest is less than 5 minute walk and the farthest around 10 minutes). The hotel looks new and the facilities are fine; the room and bathroom are a good size and beds/pillows were comfy. Our room was on the 2nd floor, quite, no view obviously but the doors are a bit heavy and they shut down aggressively so if you‚Äôre a light sleeper like me, make sure to take your ear plugs as to not wake up on ever door shut. \nBreakfast was fine, nothing special, same thing repeats everyday but it has all the basics (Croissant are gooood!)\nThe staff are amazing and super helpful. My parents had an issue with their AC and the 2 ladies at reception did everything they could (at 2 am!) to move them to a better room (special thanks to you girls, unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to know your names :/ but you know who you areüëè)\nI‚Äôd definitely stay at Pol & Grace hotel again!",
