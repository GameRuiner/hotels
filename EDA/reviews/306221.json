We asked to change the room and they gave us another one with the same smell.\nThe hotel is very central which is nice during day time but not that nice during night time. Breakfast is ok. If t weren't by the smell of cigar, it could be a very reasonable stay as its price is very competitive.",

      "text": "The Baylan Basmane hotel in Izmir is mainly a business use as its in the heart of the city. It had good reviews as why we booked it it was only 3 star. The staff were fantastic always very helpful and curtious . It is a bed and breakfast only hotel but very well run and an excellent clean dining room either very efficient staff with very good Covid 19 awareness in place. We stayed for 11 nights while our family of four were in the city for our dental treatment. Although the area outside of the hotel is not the best the hotel and staff was very good and made our stay worthwhile. I would advise anyone staying in Izmir city for any form of medical treatment to stay at this hotel. It is very comfortable nice big rooms especially kale our room on top floor which had very large sun terrace and a lounge with sofas we could all use as a family at evening time to socialise as we took up the total 3 rooms on the top floor and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very reasonably priced and eating out is so cheap lots of restaurants in the vicinity including Burger King  Chinese restaurant and local cuisine restaurants all around the hotel area. Thank you to the manager and staff  for making our stay safe and enjoyable and for supplying everything for our needs without hesitation.",
