      "text": "Complaint for Kingston Castle hotel\nWe are very unhappy since we checked in this hotel.\n1) Check in time took very long ,I was not well but they refused to hurry up. My kids room was given 30 min post 2 pm which was when our rooms were told to be allotted to us yet their bathroom tub was dirty.\n2) The view from the rooms was a dilapidated building with clothes hanging \n3) Room has a very dingy feel and no good lighting\n4) Bathroom no hot water is not hot enough in the shower and tub no hot water\n5) Bed mattress was very hard and we had a uncomfortable sleep\n6)The tea/ coffe in the room did not have enough choices so we could even enjoy a cup of tea in the morning\n7) We asked for water and they said only two bottles will be given for the entire day and they will charge for rest wherein other hotels they do not charge when we take as many bottles of water from housekeeping\n8) Locker was non functional,some old style where we could not keep our valuables\n9) The lobby ac was so cold and was giving me cold allergy ,when I asked to make it less .The manager told me to wear more warm clothes as they have to follow government guidelines for air conditioning\n9) The buffet was very bad , the food was stale We tried hummus ,feta both were very stale .The pasta was very horrible and there was no live counter for eggs and no fresh juice. Very bad display and stale food .We left hungry and we didn't want to fall sick .\n10) The pool had few sunbeds where used cutlery was lying and a shabby person was serving drinks from a tacky fridge.\n11) We had paid earlier for three days and when we left after two days as on the 2nd day they did not clean our room and forgot to give a small cake for my son which we had informed them in the morning for a surprise birthday for him.We were again disappointed.",
