The only window you can open is the one from the inner side where a fan is working 24/7. You can watch there some wires and.... some light.  Very big room with kitchen... why do i need a kitchen in a business trip???\nRoom.. 2/5 \nBed..not very confortable... 3/5.\nBath.. small and very uncomfortable, maybe 2 stars hotel, no shampoo, no  body shampoo, just a cheap \"soap\" on a disposable machine.\nBig sinking on bathroom floor when you take a shower!\nSo bath.. 1/5\nBreakfast.. probably perfect for turkish people, very poor for me...2/5\nAverage: 2 stars hotel\nP.S: Do not ask for taxi from reception! Even if you ask, ask before the trip for the price! Cheated with ~ 30 Turkish lira for a trip.... the guys from reception are \" hand in hand \" with taxi operators....:(",

We really like the location and the lobby of the hotel, the room was also good and handy. Yet the room was a bit noisy because of the fridge or when the other guests on the next door used the bathroom, fan started to work and it makes noise while you are sleeping. The breakfast was great, you may find all choices of Turkish breakfast, most of the breakfast was natural foods(might be organic). Thanks for the all staff.",
