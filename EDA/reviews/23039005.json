      "text": "Sleep and fly is brilliant for resting during longer connections. I had over 10 hours of connecting flight. Pre-booked the sleep and fly facilities for 10 hours. There are 3 packages 7am-1pm, 1pm-11pm and 11pm-7am. Very reasonably priced. \nThey have single or double cabins. You can also book per hour I believe which I have not tried and cannot comment on. \n\nThe sleep cabin I booked comprised of an electronically controlled chair that turned into a single bed. There is ample space to place a cabin bag and an additional rucksack. The cabin offers charging points and AC and a folding table tray. Very convenient facility to put your head down and catchup on sleep or rest comfortably. \n\nThe toilet facilities are right outside the entrance to the sleep and fly at Concourse C but no showers. The sleep and fly at Concourse B, Terminal 3 offers shower facilities. Please bring your own toiletry and towels. There are free showers near B17 Gate. \n\nOverall highly recommended for longer stopovers for connecting flights. \nPlease note this is for Transit ONLY.  \n\nAsk the staff to lock the cabin if you want to browse around the airport duty free or get a bite to eat. \nVery helpful staff.",

      "text": "Having 4.5 hours between flights we decided to book a Sleep 'N fly cabin at Terminal 3 in the middle of the C-Gates where our flight also was continuing. Check-in was easy and we really could get a good rest, the cabins being nearly soundproof. Relaxation is better than in the paid lounges. The only downside was the toilet, it's the public toilet out on the terminal you have to go to. Our departing gate was just minutes away.\n\nObviously a lot of reviews in this section are referring to a different Sleep 'N fly at the airport as there are several in terminal 3 and in other terminals too. So check the webpage thoroughly to get what you expect.\n\nI would book a Sleep 'N fly cabin anytime again also for quite a short stay of only a couple of hours. It's worth having your own space and some silence in the hustle and bustle of the airport. You have got everything you need and it's clean.",
