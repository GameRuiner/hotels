      "text": "Hotel Galaxias is a brilliantly positioned hotel for the Rhodes traveller.  Cheaper than many other hotels that are near/in the Old town, it needs a 20 minute walk through the backstreets of Rhodes to where all the action is. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are clean, well-maintained and quiet. The plus sides to the hotel include excellent wi-fi, luxurious dining/breakfast area and a private balcony. When there was a problem (i.e leaking air con) it was dealt with quickly. The only room issue I could see was that the shower is too small and water leaks onto the bathroom floor, I doubt a large person would enjoy a shower and could probably not turn around easily. Bear in mind this hotel has the usual Greek toilets (no toilet paper down the toilet) so it may cause alarm to some. There was only one other problem I found with the hotel - my family were staying near the Old town and wanted to visit me in my room, but the hotel has a very strict policy of not allowing anyone else in apart from those staying into the hotel unless they surrender their passports at the desk. Even then the possible visit time was limited . I could not understand this policy as I have been to many hotels around the world even the luxurious one do not have this policy. I can only assume they've had an issue with damage in the past from outside guests but I found it rather strange they wouldn't allow anyone else in, even if I knew them. Apart from this,  I can highly recommend Hotel Galaxias to any Rhodes traveller.",

      "text": "The hotel is perfectly located just few minutes away of the old town of Rhodes. It is 5 minutes away by car, or 15 min. on foot. Moreover there are two big super markets nearby that you can buy everything you need for your staying, lots of restaurants and opposite the hotel is a great bakery called \"Kantis\" which has delicious products. You can easily find parking spaces for your car , as there are plenty of space just outside the hotel. \n\nIf you want to explore the rest of the island, then you are nearby the two main roads, Rodou -Lindou highway , Ialissos highway which takes you to the western side of the island. \n\nThe rooms were very nice, comfy and clean. The clean lady changed our sheets and towels every day . \n\nThe receprion ladies were all very friendly and willing to help us and guide us. \n\nIf you are travelling with your kids, there are three  public playgrounds around the hotel. \n\nTo sum up the hotel is the best choice if you want explore the island of Rhodes, stay in a nice renovated room, without having to pay a lot of money for your staying.",

Rest of staff was really nice and kind too. Cleanliness of the room and common areas was spotless. Breakfast was really nice with different options served in the lovely garden. Close to the old town too. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone!!",

      "text": "I had an amazing stay at a very good price in this hotel. Hotel staff could not be more polite, helpful and accommodating, whereas they do their best so that they themselves as well as guests are in a hygienic and clean environment, following the necessary protocols in the most efficient way possible. The room was spacious and nicely decorated, with a king size bed, a balcony with two chairs and a table, as well as a foldable clothing rack, which is a very useful feature. Also, a bottle of wine with two glasses was waiting on the table, as well as a bottle of water in the minibar, which were also greatly apprecieted. I would have preferred it if there had been a shower booth instead of a shower curtain, but that was the only drawback and not really a major one.\n\nThe hotel floors were luminous and beautifully decorated, whereas breakfast was served in the garden, which is also a quite pleasant way to start the day. Small details, such as speakers in the form of a rock playing some relaxing music in the garden, cannot but be greatly appreciated.\n\nGenerally, there is attention to detail, from decorating the hotel to guest accommodation, and health prevention measures.  The only reason why I award it with 4 points instead of 5 is breakfast, which was nice and more than enough, but did not have the variety I would like to see to give a higher score. It was quite good, satisfying, but not extraordinary.\n\nTo sum up, I will definitely book my stay there again if I return to Rhodes.",
