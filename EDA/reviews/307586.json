      "text": "This hotel has the perfect location. It's situated in the middle of Konak and Alsancak right on the waterfront. We had a room with a sea view and the sunsets were amazing from our balcony. Apart from the perfect location, this hotel is a bit run down and very outdated. Our room was clean, but it's in desperate need of updating. It seems like the hotel was busy working on one of the floors, so hopefully, things will look better soon.\n\nThe beds and bedding did not feel like great quality. Something like a mattress topper and better pillows will improve sleep quality a lot. The blanket in the cupboard was also not very soft.\n\nSomething to keep in mind with booking a sea view room, the restaurants downstairs are very noisy till late at night. You can hear conversations and cutlery moving. The AC is ancient and had a strange smell when we tried to turn it on, so we opted to sleep with the balcony door open. Luckily we are deep sleepers, otherwise, this would have been a problem with the noise from below.\n\nFont desk staff speak English but were of no help when asked how to get a public transport card or questions on how to get to certain attractions. The Izmirim card for public transport can be purchased at the offices left of the pedestrian bridge as you head to Konak. Nevertheless, the staff was still friendly and helped with our bags.\n\nBreakfast had a good selection of food. Coffee and juice are served in paper cups, which is not great for the price you pay to stay here. It would really not take much to have proper glasses and mugs. The juice was Cappy juice from a bottle - other hotels in Turkey in the same price range serve fresh juice.",

      "text": "Even though the city of Izmir gave a great impression, unfortunately this hotel ruined the full experience! The personnel was not helpful at all regarding trips, transportation or opening hours and advised us to use google, where everything is not updated online during covid. The hotel room looked ok, but the bathroom was dirty and was spread with remains of some sort of bugs. We made the hotel aware and their solution was to give us another room, exactly 2 floors below the one we had. Fair enough. We went to check it out and fould a dead cockroach on the floor so our only option was to return to our first room. The bed sheets and duvet cover was also dirty and had black stains. We thought maybe it was permanent marks and we removed the sign saying \"please dont change my sheets\" in hopes of it being changed as a solution. The following day we went on a full day trip, and when we returned we found the exact stains on the bed. We called reception to ask if they changed the sheets daily to which they replied \"yes, ofcourse\" so we went down to show them the dirty stains. The guy at the reception was very rude and yelled \"what can I do about it\". No apology, no explanation, no correction that the sheets were not changed daily! He only informed us that we could speak with the manager in the morning and at least they brought us a new duvet cover. Disgusting hotel! Service is non exsistent!",
