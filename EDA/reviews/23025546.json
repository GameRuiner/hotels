      "text": "The restaurant on the ground floor nearby the reception, its name is “foodie” : the staff was eating food nonstop and everyone I come there someone from F&B team was chewing the food in their mouse and speaking to me. Additionally, there is no one at the restaurant when you come there to eat. Very low quality of service and standards. Some staff was weird , to be honest lots of trainings are required to F&B personal. One time I came for breakfast and there was no clean table at all, it was only 8:00am - many times I’ve heard restaurant workers complaining about their job and commenting things loudly - it’s not acceptable for hotel type of accommodation. Very disappointing. Room was specious and cleaning was fine. The recommendation: please wash window curtains at least once per week . It’s very dusty and dirty . Same with sofa in the living room, you can see many spots on it and I had no desire to seat there even. Bedroom was ok. Very loud music in the hallway on the floors - I could hear inside my room the outdoor sound. I won’t come back there . Please take it as a constructive suggestion for improvements. Thanks !",
