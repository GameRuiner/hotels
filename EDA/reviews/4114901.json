      "text": "We have stayed at this property numerous times when it was run by its predecessor The Oberoi. The Oberoi was of the highest standard. Having returned to Dubai after a few years, we thought we would give The Anantara a try as we love the room size and the location.  Unfortunately, there were many glitches in our stay. The service overall was poor - this includes reception, housekeeping, in room dining. The staff appear to be amateurs. We complained on more than one occasion and the hotel was slow to respond. The offering at breakfast was also poor. The breakfast area was grimy. The floors and tables were not clean - no side plates, lots of crumbs. The waiters were slow.  The plates were scratched. It is a pity that The Anantara has not been able to maintain the high standards that were previously set at this property.",
