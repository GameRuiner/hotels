      "text": "There are things that the hotel can control and things they can't.\nThe hotel is fantastic however the room that we occupied was extremely tired and was in desperate of a makeover.  It was very clean and tidy but dated.\nThe Seabreeze restaurant, for us, was the jewel in the Nile.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are brilliant with the staff always ready to satisfy your needs.\nThe beach with Abdul, Sulaimon and the rest of the staff were fantastic catering for your every need.  \nThings not in control of the hotel are loud Italians and even louder and rude Russians who will invade every space, on the beach, that they feel fit.  The sunbeds are plenty but shade is a premium which the Russians have no hesitation in occupying, regardless of whoever is already there.\nAll of the staff are very friendly and helpful so if you do need anything just ask and don't complain afterwards.  They all work extremely hard all day, especially on the beach, so be nice to them and maybe reward them. \nMusic on the beach is far too unnecessarily loud so try and get as far away from the sound system as possible.  There was some kind of children's party at the beach restaurant which was cruel as the extremely loud music was playing next to them without the children having ear protection.",

      "text": "We have just returned from a two week holiday in March where we stayed at the Reef Oasis Blue Bay & Spa hotel. This is our third stay at this hotel and yet again we were not disappointed. The hotel layout, pools and restaurants are perfect and accommodation is set in beautifully maintained gardens.\nHowever it is the overwhelming kindness and willingness of the staff who endeavour to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.\nThe guest relation ladies, Simone, Emma and Amy are always so helpful always there with a smile and ready to help with the booking of restaurants, checking of rooms and any advice you may need during your stay.\nThe rooms are a little dated but are cleaned and replacement towels provided every day of your stay. Our cleaner was called Hamdy and I have never known anyone work so hard, every day a cheery greeting and checking to see if we need anything. \nAlso I canâ€™t leave this review without mentioning the waiters in all the restaurants who work tirelessly to serve you food and drinks. They are so friendly and it was lovely to see a few familiar faces. We joke with one of the waiters, Mahmoud, but who calls himself Ashley Cole ðŸ˜€, but they are all so helpful.\nIn addition the managers too are supportive of their staff and on many occasions during our stay we saw examples of them helping their colleagues at busy times in the restaurants.\nIn addition we just wanted to say a big thank you to Mr Reder, he oversees all the food/restaurants and is so personable. He interacts with all the guests, checking they are happy with the food. We have to say the food in the restaurants is excellent and so much variety, buffet, Fishermanâ€™s Restaurant, French Restaurant and A La Carte dining (Indian/Chinese) and our favourite The Italian Restaurant.\nThank you to everyone and weâ€™ll be seeing you again next year.",
