      "text": "Wow, wow, wow!! This is quite possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed at. \nThe location is perfect – just outside Lindos town, so it’s very very peaceful. \nThe private beach is just lovely - bottled water provided, comfortable beds and loungers, waiter service, no kids, and crystal clear water!!\nOur room was just beautiful, the view was unbelievable. Room was serviced twice a day, clean beach towels every day. \nOn arrival there was a surprise cake and champagne in our room as it was our 10th Wedding Anniversary!! \nDespoina (Debbie) on reception was wonderful, and helped us with car hire, taxis, transfers, restaurant recommendations etc. \nBreakfast is on a beautiful terrace overlooking the infinity pool and the sea. The food is so good and the staff so attentive. Special mention to the lovely Rania who made us feel so special, she even taught us some Greek every morning!\nWe ate in the restaurant twice and it was honestly absolutely fantastic and Manolis looked after us superbly. We can’t wait to go back!!",

The staff are the best we have ever come across, always happy, friendly and helpful and always knew who you were, nothing was too much trouble, which totally made this holiday one of the best we have ever had.  The rooms are lovely, the food was fantastic as were the cocktails, which we had on the lovely balcony at the bar area every night before dinner, whilst watching the sunset.  The two pool areas were lovely and it was the most relaxed holiday we have had.  We are currently looking for this year’s holiday and really wanted to try another Greek Island, but we keep being drawn back to Lindos Blu, so expect to see us again in June!",

Since then I have texted you 3 times to double check if you have mistaken our resort with a different one and I  still have not got a reply by your side.\n\nI can understand that your summer holidays did not meet your expectations, which is very unfortunate, but it is, the least, unfair for us to be low-scored after a successful summer season and after all the excellent work our team did in order to achieve so high results from a guest that did not stay at our premises and did not experience our services.\n\nI would, dearly, appreciate it if you could find some of your valuable time to reply to my direct messages.\n\nBest regards,\n\nNikos Triantafillakis\nResident Manager ",
