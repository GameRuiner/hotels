Ahmed cleaned our room to a very high standard every day as well as creating some amazing towel sculptures. Would definitely recommend and revisit the hotel again! Buffet food is okay however the restaurants really impressed us and can’t recommend the Teppanyaki restaurant enough. We stayed in room 712 which was the perfect distance to the beach and pool.",

      "text": "Please read to the end. As have left the negatives to last.\n First the positives.\n Great hotel. Grounds are kept immaculate. The cleaning teams are amazing. Couldn't do enough for us.  If you upgrade your room you get a larger room. \nRestaurant staff where great special thanks goes to Abdul. very entertaining and friendly. Great with kids. It's amazing what fun the staff can create with a simple balloon to keep the kids happy. . Bar staff where great and very friendly. \nThere is only one pool and a little paddle pool for tots. The beach has lots of quiet areas and best of all the coral reef. You can swim and snorkel here and there is a jetty that will take you to the edge of the reef where you can snorkel on days when the sea allows. \nThe negatives.\n These hotels are a distance from the centre of Sharm so you might feel isolated. We however didn't have a problem with this. \nIf your the sort of person who gets eaten alive by mosquito s then go with an arsenal of repellents. \nLastly no quiet pool and the music is way to loud most of the day round the pool driving many guests to the beach away from the noise. We where advised that the sister hotel next door The Park Hotel has the same noise issues round the pool.\nThe entertainment crew appeared uninterested. Let's the hotel down. \nLastly not suitable for those with mobility issues due to pathways being uneven.",

      "text": "Hotel is ok. Rooms dated and looking tired. Food is ok,nothing amazing. Service is terrible in the restaurant and also at the outside bar at night we ended up fetching our own drinks . We felt it was more like eating in a works canteen than a restaurant. We ate most nights at Charmillion Club, better experience.We tipped but they really didn’t deserve it. One night we sat outside the bar  and we were served drinks in plastic cups. If you're looking to relax and chill around the pool, forget it. The night club style music was blasting like no one's business at 10.30am and the bass could be heard on the beach next door. It was diabolical. The animation team was playing music for their tastes and not that of the people around the pool and it was way too loud to relax there. The beach itself isn’t great, the sand is only what I could call builders sand (man made) . You can’t swim in the sea it’s too shallow (cornered off with floats and rope) and full of stones/rocks. There is a platform to snorkel from but closed off if windy . (not the best area for snorkelling). The cleaner did an ‘OK’ job he missed details, he didn’t really deserve a tip but he got one anyway. The gardens/ground were kept immaculate , those guys do a great job. Entertainment is zilch for adults but plenty for kids albeit the animation team were very amateurish and it showed in their dancing, which was embarrassing at times to see. This is a basic all inclusive hotel and nothing to shout about, Drinks  outside are small plastic/paper cups, you wouldn’t even get a half pint beer in them. Snacks at the beach were limited and often cold.   You can’t get a decent cup of coffee. It’s all out of a machine and was awful. Despite all this we still had a nice holiday but that was because we spent our time at the Charmillion Club resorts beach in the day time and also at night time. Should we return we would stay next door at the Charmillion Club Resort It's much nicer. Their staff was better, hotel food was better presented and appeared to have more choice. We paid just over £500 for a week and wouldn’t pay much more to stay here even in the height of summer. But we got what we paid for, if we paid more , We wouldn’t have been happy .",

      "text": "The stay was overall very nice. We were staying in room 428 and the cleaning service was excellent. Our man was Taric, very nice, polite and helpful. He was very cheerful made nice towel figures and cleaned the room very nicely.  Was probably the best one from the staff. Because the rest was not so good. The service at the restaurant was poor, slow with cleaning, not so helpful, they were walking around not really knowing what to do with themselves. The barmans were slightly rude. Too little food and snacks between the restaurant hours. And the animation team was tragic. Some of them looked like they were afraid to talk to people. However the beach bar was very good with tasty snacks. The rooms were clean and nicely equipped. The hotel overall is very clean and cozy. The beach is big and clean same with the pool area. If you don't mind the staff then the hotel is actually not so bad.",
