      "text": "The Hotel is in a central location about a block off Las Ramblas so the location is not that safe but ideal because it is central. That is all that it has going for. We encountered numerous problems that made our stay, not an ideal one. These are some of the issues we encountered:\n\n1. On our first night, the shower flooded causing water to spill every where. There was \n     over an inch of water which we did not realize was flooding.\n2. The shower faucet was broken and twisted a finger trying to open and close it\n     A. The only really nice Hotel staff member with great customer service was Oscar\n           He changed our room to a similar one. He was always very friendly, genuine \n           and nice to us when ever we encountered him. (It was a pleasure for us meeting \n           and speaking with him)\n3. Unfortunately the other room also had extremely slow drains so we had to be extra \n     careful, not to slip and fall in the semi flooded shower. \n4. The sinks, if not paying attention, would overflow. Additionally, the smell of mold \n     would come up from the sinks after use\n5.  The other issue was television did not work (in the whole hotel) for the 4 nights we \n       stayed. The response was always (Technician is working on this)\n6. We tried their breakfast, and not only was the food and quality very poor but for \n      the content, expensive\n7. For a hotel that advertises as a 4 star hotel, the bed/mattress equates to the \n    comfort of a hostel. The most uncomfortable bed for we have experienced\n8. Fixtures in the room like the vents seemed like they were going to fall off\n9. Aside from Oscar, the rest of the Hotel staff do not seem to be happy working \n    there. And the perception is that they  are very unhappy and do not want to be \n    bothered. \n\nSo our advise, is really look for another hotel elsewhere in Barcelona until this hotel can fix these issues and really becomes a 4 Star Hotel.",
