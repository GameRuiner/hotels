      "text": "Initially chosen for location and its proximity to one of Gaudi’s less known buildings. \n\nIt turns out that La Rambla is no longer one of Barcelona’s prime locations, as in recent years it’s lost its glamour to the awful nightlife that takes over at around 11:00 each night. \n\nMy recommendation is that you stay elsewhere in the city, but if you just stay near La Rambla, this is one of the best value-for-money options, and you get fantastic views from the rooftop. \n\nGood breakfast too and adequate reception service.",

      "text": "This was my 6th trip to Barcelona as it’s my favourite place to be in the world but always had rather hit or miss experiences with the hotels I’ve stayed at…not this one. This is hands down the best one i have stayed at while in the city. \n\nWe arrived early Sunday morning (10/3/24) and were greeted with the sight of the rather grand Güell Palace which is directly across the road from the hotel, then greeted with the extremely friendly and attentive reception staff, again, hotel staff all around the world can be hit and miss in terms of general friendliness and helpfulness but the staff here go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and are more than happy to give you helpful tips on where to eat and shop. Perfecte! \n\nThe rooms are extremely clean with cleaning staff cleaning the rooms daily. In terms of dining I would urge anyone who stays to go for the breakfast option with booking as it caters for every palate and nationality imaginable with the freshest pastries, cereals, meats and cheeses on offer. \n\nThe rather picky previous reviews about the No tea or coffee making facilities kind of deafeats the object of the hotel bar/cafe and the many wonderful independent coffee shop surrounding you in the Barrio Gothic. \n\nOn our last day we’re were allowed to keep our baggage in a storage area in the car park next door as our flight was later that evening, a service I’ve never previously seen executed without a fee involved, these guys don’t charge for this facility which is incredible! The lady on reception even offered us the restroom and one more look on the breathtaking roof top terrace over looking the city (which is a must!) Before we left. \n\nI actually left this hotel heavy hearted as I didn’t want to leave! We will 100% be back when in Barca again! Moltes Gracies to everyone at the Gaudi Hotel!",
