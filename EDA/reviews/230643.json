      "text": "The purpose of this review is to save other people from the trauma I suffered. We booked this hotel for 5 nights but left after 3 due to me being robbed of a necklace in daylight 500m from the hotel.\nHotel itself is acceptable (certainly not 4 star) but clean albeit tired.\nI was aware of the pickpocket pandemic that Barcelona suffers, but never expected as a 6ft well built male, to be assaulted in broad daylight and robbed of a precious item, so close to this hotel.\nDespite the ongoing trauma suffered (I am writing this 10 days after arriving home) the hotel would not entertain refunding the 2 nights we lost (either directly or through Booking.com).\nPickpocketing has, post-covid, escalated to crimes against the person in this city. I'm 51 years old, have travelled extensively and have never felt so nervous and vulnerable in any other city. This is not because of the assault, I felt it from arrival and was almost waiting for the assault or pickpocketing to happen at every turn.",

      "text": "I stayed at Hotel Barcelona Universal as a solo traveler, and overall, it was okay. The location, near Paral·lel metro station, the Ramblas, and the Gothic Quarter (approx. 20 minute walk) , was great. However, I won't stay here again because of the noise from corridor conversations and neighboring bathrooms (shower pipes) . Despite this, I didn't hear any noise from outside and I enjoyed recovering in the room when needed. The room was luxurious, and the cleaning staff did a great job. Fantastic complimentary coffee machine in the lobby. The breakfast, priced at approx. €18, wasn't worth it, given coffee shops nearby. Overall, it's not a bad location for a first trip to Barcelona, but it's not the one for me.",
