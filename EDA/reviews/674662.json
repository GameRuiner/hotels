Service at the hotel (room cleaning, restaurant etc) is fantastic - Rejith at the bfst restaurant managed 15 tables all by himself and still provided personalized service!  Amazing marina garden restaurant next door wt Indian, Chinese, American cuisine.  Only -negatives are: \n1) single rooms are on the 3rd floor and it can get pretty noisy. \n2) The front desk staff seem a bit overwhelmed and could be a bit more welcoming at checkin\n Overall just a wonderful place.
