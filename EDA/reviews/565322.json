      "text": "We spent 10 days at this fantastic hotel during 28/03/2024. -7/4/2024. \nWe had a family room overlooking the pool on block 3. We could not fault the quality and cleanliness of the room. It was cleaned daily, with fresh towels and air fresheners. \nThe food at the buffet restaurant was of a good standard and plenty of choice and daily rotation. Plenty of fresh fish, salads , kebabs and desserts. \nWe used all the hotel pools and aqua park. The lifeguards, bar staff and towel guy there was very attentive especially with our two children. We felt safe allowing them to use the facilities. Big thank you to Saeed at the aqua park.\nAt the bar near the main pool, a Very Very Big thank you to Ashraf and Mina. They were so attentive and by the second day, they new what we drank and how we wanted it prepared. Nothing was ever a problem for them.\nThe biggest highlight for my wife and I was the hotel SPA. We booked a package of massages, pedicures and hair treatments through Saed. Thank you for your leadership, great salesmanship and accommodating our requests. Nour the hairdresser was so patient with our kids, Fatma and Rehan and Zakar we amazing in the spa. They are really the dream team.\nAlina from the animation team was really good, especially with the kids mini disco and the easter egg hunt. We had a foam party in the main pool on easter Sunday which was awesome. Otherwise, the rest of the animation team were pretty invisible.\nThank you Iryna from guest relations and Kareem from the front desk. You are both charming and approachable \nWe visited both beaches and definitely recommend the coral beach for snorkelling.\nWe and our kids thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will come again in the future.\n\nW",

      "text": "We visited the hotel as a family of four  (two adults and four year old twins) and we stayed for 12 nights. \n\nThe positives are:\nThe water park is great - with a range of slides. \nMost of the waiting staff are really friendly and helpful.\nThe freshly cooked eggs and omelettes at breakfast are really tasty as are the freshly cooked doughnuts and pancakes.\nThe towels and bedding were clean and changed regularly. \nThe dolphin pool is heated (however it wasn’t while we were there as they informed us they’d turned it off as it’s getting towards summer.)\nThe grounds are really well maintained.\nThe manager is very present and does speak to guests.\nKelly at Guest Relations is really helpful if you have any issues.\nThe bus to Coral Beach is free (book it the day before at reception)\nYou can get towels for the beach and pool at different kiosks.\nThe life guards at the beach were excellent - Marwan (and the other one who’s name I can’t remember but I did tell the manager how good they are) They helped with snorkelling and would take you along the reef with a ring to guide you to the best spots. \nThe Italian restaurant (al a carte) makes a change but has to be pre booked and menu choices made the day before. (It’s all pre made when you get there and lined up ready for being served) The main waiter in there is lovely.\nThey did make some nice animals out of the towels which the children enjoyed. \n\nNegatives\nThe food is very repetitive (we ate out five nights at local restaurants/on trips) but it’s kind of what you’d expect.\nThe room although was attended to daily by the cleaner wasn’t really ever cleaned or dusted. He mopped the floor (not particularly well) and made the beds.\nThe air con was unreliable- we had them out to see to it every other night for the first week as it kept not working. They did suggest we moved rooms after a week but we said we’d give it one last try (and a different maintenance guy came out to it and put a new wire on and that solved the problem)\nThe plug got stuck in the sink so they sent maintenance out and he removed the plug and said not to use the plug as it would happen again. The other bathroom didn’t have a plug either.\nThe shower drains were filthy! Covered in hair which I had to remove!\nThe drinks are served in small beakers or glasses (although they’re happy you get a few at a time)\nThe cocktails aren’t served in cocktail glasses, when I asked for a nice glass they said that the nice glasses are for the paid drinks. \nThe entertainment was poor to say the least - a lot of the team sit round the pool chatting to each other or flirting with guests (the only one I would rate remotely as doing their job was the girl who did the mini disco every night) but it was very repetitive with the same repertoire of songs.\nOn our first week we turned up at 12 o’clock for the advertised foam party to be told they’d decided to cancel it and move it to the Sunday for Easter (no signs or anything informing people) Lots of guests complained about it so Kelly sorted it and put it on that afternoon at 3pm so people didn’t miss out. \nThe ice creams are only available between 1pm and 3pm and they’re tiny Mr Whippy style ones.!\nThe WiFi is free but they’ve blocked Trip Advisor!! We bought Egyptian SIM cards for £10 each and could access it through that.\nThe taxi’s available outside the hotel are very expensive so I suggest walking down the driveway to either hail a taxi or get an In- drive (Ubers equivalent) The security won’t let taxi’s or mini buses for excursions on site so you have to walk to and from them (unless of course you’ve booked direct with the hotel then they let them on site!) but of course you’ve paid a huge premium by booking \ntrips on site! \n\nHopefully this review gives a good clear picture of the hotel. For what we paid we would go back but some people paid a considerable amount more than we did! \nHappy to answer any questions. Hopefully the number of reviews I have done on here shows my profile is legit.",
