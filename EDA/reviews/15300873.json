      "text": "I thought the hotel's decor was stunning.\nSuch a beautiful lounge, with a gorgeous Frida Kahlo Wall and tea and water for guests to help themselves to. The hotel's warmly lit appearance from the front is something special and memorable - and the staff were all really nice people. Metin and Murat were very kind and helpful to us and both spoke very good English :-) We came for 2 nights from England and are familiar with Izmir ; Alsancak is a lively urban area full of restaurants, cafes and is open till late at  night. If you want to feel the young buzz of Alsancak, I'd say come here. Our room was really cosy and clean, the shower worked well and we had a pretty balcony! √áok te≈üekk√ºr ederim!",
