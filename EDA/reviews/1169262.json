Very very bad food quality, didnt like the service and they allow people to go around and sell stuff and that is pretty annoying. Mosquitos in the rooms, in the reception and everywhere and they dont do anything about it. Bad safety and hygiene, they would spray anti flies that are posiones and dont care about ur safety and health. Not worth the money at all. The place look perfect in pictures but it is a big scammmmm!!! The beach is not sandy, it is big salt sand that hurts the feet. Dont wast ur money!! The food is very bad! We had “All inclusive” only to get snacks that are cheese sandwiches and they dont change anything, no other snacks, they reuse the old food!!! Very bad quality.\nMosquites everywhere, when i asked them to do something about it, they came and spray anti flies all over the room while we are in there, had to change the room and asked for something electric to have in the room, they said that we would get it the day after, didnt get anything!!!!!\n\nPoor animation team, nothing interesting, they dont invite people and mostly interested in russian people only.\n\nThe food quality is very poor. No taste, overcooked, very bad quality and cold food.",

We offer chicken, duck, turkey, lamb, veal, meat, fish and seafood prepared in various ways for lunch and dinner, pasta and pizza stations as well as fresh fruit and vegetables are available every day at the main restaurant.\nThe restaurant on the beach offers guests several types of pizza, burgers, shawarma, spaghetti, Greek salad, Caesar salad. We are very upset and apologize to you that we were not able to satisfy and delight you from this range of food products and dishes. We are surprised to read that food has no taste. Trying to please many guests with different taste preferences, we decided that you can diversify the taste yourself by adding salt, pepper and other spices or sauces, which are presented in the Restaurant. \n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to clarify that as part of our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness and safety, our swimming pools undergo a thorough disinfection process in the evenings. This measure ensures the health and well-being of all our guests. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.\n\nWe understand that uninvited vendors can be disruptive, and we are looking into this matter to ensure our guests' relaxation is not disturbed. For a future occasion, please, take a red flag at a towel station and no one at the beach will disturb you.\n\nThe presence of mosquitoes is a challenge we are continually addressing, and we apologize for any discomfort caused. Please rest assured that we adhere to strict health and safety protocols.\n\nWe regret that the beach did not meet your expectations; we are fortunate to have a unique coastal location that we hope can be appreciated in its natural beauty. \n\nLastly, we regret to hear that our entertainment did not live up to your expectations and seemed to lack inclusivity. The team works tirelessly every day to keep our guests entertained by preparing shows and activities that appeal to our guests of all ages and nationalities which is quite a difficult task and they really are a valued asset of our hotel, we deeply regret reading that their efforts have not been appreciated.   \n\nBest regards,\n\nHotel Management",
