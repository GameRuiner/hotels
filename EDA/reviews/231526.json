Alex recommended excellent restaurants and gave us safety tips to ensure we visited the right places at the right time.  Alex was also very caring and insightful when recommending taxi service and pharmacy care. \n\nOur family highly recommends Hotel Rialto in Barcelona and meeting Alex Sanchez is a must.  The Rialto has an exceptional breakfast for guest which includes unlimited Cava.  An amazing experience!!",

      "text": "Great location, very close to Las ramblas and other tourist attractions, all in walking distance. Also about a 2 min walk to a courtyard full of great restaurants. \nThe hotel was clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful even after arriving very late into the night. The room itself was great for the price, comfortable bed, big shower and very clean throughout. The breakfast had a massive selection and the food was very good and a great price. The only issue we had was that the air conditioning in the room did not go below 19°c which made it extremely warm in the room, at one point the temperature read 29°c. We asked at reception and were told that it was set at that level and could not be changed until the summer season started. We kept the windows open which helped a little but still found it quite warm. Overall though it was a great hotel with many good qualities, I would definitely recommend and stay again.",

The hotel staff was super helpful and even helped us buy tickets for excursions! We were also very happy with the breakfast. It was an additional charge but it was a buffet and it was well worth the price!! The only down side would be that we couldn’t control the room temperature and it was warm in the room so we had to keep the window open all of the time. We definitely recommend this hotel!",
