      "text": "Big spacious room with all the required things provided, big bay windows overlooking side field. Room are clean and house keeping attends the room daily to change the towels and clean the room. Good comfortable beds and sofa, greater options of TV channels for westerners. Wifi was excellent very fast. Spacious bathroom and shower cubical. \n\nHotel is located just outside the Metro station across the road which is very convenient if you are tourist like us. Easy access to all major tourist locations. Great selections of food places just by the hotel, you donâ€™t have to travel far for evening or afternoon meals. Mall of Emirates is 5min walk away. Hotel is in a prime location and good friendly staff. I would definitely be happy to stay there again if Iâ€™m back in Dubai any time soon. Credit goes to the hotel staff for providing 5* service to all guests. \n\nBreakfast options are limited and seemed a bit lost in identity. Typical case of when you are trying to cater for all nationality on a small budget. Nor could we have full English or nor could we have full Indian or continental. Also seemed to be short of cups and plates every morning at busy periods, we had to wait round for someone to collect the used ones and wash them and bring them back to the dining hall. During our stay it looked like majority of the guests were from Kazakhstan.",
