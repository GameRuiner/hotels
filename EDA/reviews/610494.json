      "text": "From the early morning greeting by Carlos, the night clerk, to the goodbye handshake of the security guard, everyone at the hotel made my stay a delight. You would expect a respected hotel to provide the basic services, but in all my travels, it is the staff that make a hotel special. And at the Barcelona Catedral they went out of their way to make sure that this solo traveler was made to feel welcome.\nEach morning, I had one of the hotel’s ample and delicious breakfasts setting me up for a full day of sightseeing. And at the end of the day, a relaxing small meal with staff making sure that I had all I required.\nI highly recommend the Barcelona Catedral for travelers seeking a centrally located hotel that goes out of its way to make sure your stay is safe, comfortable and stress-free.",
