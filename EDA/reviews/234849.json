It is situated in the thriving Gracia area which is a more local area with great shops, restaurants, cafes and bakeries. It is away from the busier tourist areas but has lots of life, is really friendly and felt totally safe. \nThe hotel is modern and extremely clean. The staff were really friendly. The rooms have a sink, hob, microwave and basic equipment that enable you to eat in if you wish after shopping in one of the many local shops. \nThe hotel is 3 minutes from one of the less popular and less commercialised Gaudi attractions, being Casa Vicens. \nThe room, hotel and area were a sanctuary away from the extremely busy tourist areas, even in March. Highly recommend this hotel. Would definitely return without hesitation.",

      "text": "Stayed here a year ago in September 2022. Looked at many places and areas in Barcelona and hoped the reviews were true. And they were. \n\nIt’s a small hotel that was in a good location in a safe area for a solo female traveler. Close to metro (about a block away) with many stores, bakeries, and restaurants close by. The room was fine for one person with a small kitchenette and fridge. Comfortable bed and clean room. Breakfast (added cost) was ok with a served plate of hams and cheeses with croissant and a cup of coffee and juice or tea. \n\nStaff was friendly and helpful with any questions and recommendations. I remember having several nice chats with Dafne and she was great. It’s within walking distance to the center (about 20 mins or so) and not in a busy touristy area, which I liked. It was also quiet at night and you would get a good nights sleep. \n\nI wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again especially if you’re traveling solo. Good safe location with a good staff! ",
