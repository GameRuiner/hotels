Restaurant (both breakfast and Tyro ) were filled with fresh and flavourful options. \nThe true star of this place is the Spa.  Wonderful treatments in a calm and relaxing  atmosphere. Dilek at the front desk made excellent suggestions  and made sure we were well taken care of during the stay. The ladies that did our hamman and massages were amazing. So patient and caring. Thank you Emi and Yani for the truly relaxing experience.  Do not miss out on this experience. \n",

I get massages in the UK quite frequently so I know a good massage & this was by far one of the best I’ve had, hand on heart.\n\nIf you travel to the Kumbahce area of Bodrum, I highly recommend you visit bodriums hotel spa.\n\nWe got an air b&b & found it super easy to call up & book for a hammam & massage, they also are easy to message on WhatsApp to reserve.\n\nFor brits who don’t know, Hammam is like a full body scrub & soapy bubbles all over.\nWe didn’t have to be guests.\n\nWith the treatment we got they give you half hour in the sauna & steam room (they also said we could come earlier for this)\n\nFollowed by half hour hammam & then 50 min massage. With the high quality of the scrub & massage however, it felt so much longer.\n\nVery reasonable price, for this kind of treatment in the uk we would pay over double at a spa this nice.\n\nWe had Kadek & wayan who are both extremely professional & both outrageously good. Got so deep in spots I didn’t know I had tension!\n\nAlso the manager dilek was so so accommodating. She talks you through the process in details, will provide you the best refreshments… wait till you try the tea 😋",
