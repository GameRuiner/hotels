I would like to mention the animators separately, it has always been fun, interesting, there are many programs to choose from: yoga, stretching and others. Daily trips to night parties accompanied and delivered, everything is organized, fun and safe.",

He accommodated us really fast so that we could grab a few drinks before closing. Soup and fresh bread was available as kitchen was already closed. From there it only got better.\nFood was freshly made every day with good variety. Water  juice and coffee stations all around hotel. Hotel looks absolutely amazing so does the pool area. Never a shortage of sun lounges. Towels issued each day.\nStaff at the bar were outstanding and couldn't be more friendly or helpful!\nEntertainment team were always available and checking on us.\nVery close to airport and in middle of town centre.\nGuys at shops also deserve a credit.\nNot once have we been asked for any tips and even if wanted to give some they wouldn't take.\nAt time it felt that staff at bar were watched by supervisor (blue shirts) which made us feel a bit uncomfortable. They wouldn't speak to any guest just watch what everyone was doing. \nOverall great experience and would recommend.",
