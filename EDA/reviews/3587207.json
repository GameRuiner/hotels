      "text": "My room was really big and clean, with a comfortable bed that was changed every other day.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location, just across the road to a mainline train station and tube.\n\nIt’s a great place to be based, with the sea just a 15 minute walk, and lots of historic sites.\n\nI’ve rarely walked as much in a break; including up a nearby mountain (well - big hill I suppose) where there was an old castle on the top. See pics.\n\nThe staff were great! Other than the catering staff they all spoke English and all of the staff were very friendly.\n\nIn case you’ve seen me review this hotel twice it’s not dodgy; I just can’t find my original review.\n\nThe breakfast was served on the top floor and the area is surrounded by huge windows giving an amazing view. There’s a large area outside so you can have a cigarette break up there enjoying the views.\n\nThe jewel of this hotel was the spa. They have a plunge pool, showers, sauna and a great massage team. I was treated by a beautiful blue eyed lady, who, after one of my really long walks, managed to get all of the knots out of my tired muscles. I’ll be in Izmir again in June and will definitely spend some time in there again.\n\nI need to address some criticisms I’ve seen in the reviews. I honestly wonder if they were writing by competing hotels..\n\nMy room was perfectly clean. It was spacious. The bathroom was perfect. Everything worked. I really don’t know how anyone would criticise the staff or the room.\n\nIf there’s one downside it was being so close to the speakers for the nearby mosque. The call to prayer was very very loud and woke me every single morning. Other than that the noise was ok, even though it was in a main road and across from the station.",

      "text": "The room decor is very dated and the two bedroom lights did not work and when I examined them further there were just bare wires inside the shade \nThe bathroom sink was cracked \nOn the balcony the guard rail was loose and dangerous to lean on \nThe drawers in the cupboards couldn’t be used as you couldn’t open them because they were too stiff \nBreakfast consisted of the usual Turkish fare olives,eggs,some tomato and onion concoction which didn’t taste too bad better than it looked \nSliced bread served out of a carrier bag and tea or Nescafé coffee I only had breakfast twice the first day for a coffee because for some reason they didn’t offer it as a room extra plenty of tea and sugar but no coffee \nI ended up buying the 3in 1 Nescafé from a local supermarket as I said I used the breakfast service twice once for coffee and the second time I tried a bit of everything on offer I wasn’t impressed so didn’t bother again \nThere is also a rule in the hotel that you cannot take food to your room and bags will be searched and any food confiscated and will only be given back on the day you leave \nThe only saving grace for the hotel was the cleaners who came every day to change towels etc and is one of the reasons the review got two stars \nIf you are offered room 206 give it a miss it might be cheap but it isn’t worth it \nAlso being right opposite the main road their is a lot of traffic noise all day and night and the mosque opposite also also has calls to prayer several times a day and the noise from the loudspeakers makes it feel as if it’s in the room \nMy impression is it needs a total makeover new decor etc to make it presentable and I do know it’s a Muslim country but like any other in the world it should be offering international fare on its breakfast menu even if it included toast it would be a positive move as long as they include butter which was something else that was missing from the breakfast fare",
