What I shall do with three single beds ! ( single beds has lower prices in the booking.com and I didn't book that room because I don't want that room , why they force me to accept it \n\nI refused strongly , so the kept me waiting for long time \n\nThen they gave me same room of three beds joined 2 beds together!  Another lie \n\nAnd they are telling simply this is the only room that they have and I have to accept it !!!!!!!! non professional attitude! \n\nThey are not professional at all , actually very horrible\n\nAnd I don't advice and person to waste your money in this",

      "text": "This hotel is NOT clean and it is NOT properly sanitized, it is NOT safe for FAMILY especially with KIDS.\n\nMy friends and I were looking for a cheap hotel where we can stay together and work remotely. We decided to try this hotel because the rates were very cheap. However, it comes with a VERY bad experience. I wouldn't say anything bad about the reception, they were fine. BUT, the hotel amenities are HORRIBLE.\n\n1. Rooms were NOT sanitized. The white linens were changed but the blue comforters were NEVER changed. We don't know when was the last time they changed that. They were too DIRTY. \n2. No sanitation for the restrooms\n3. Poor cleaning routine\n4. Poor wifi\n5. No dial tone\n\nHow did we know? One of our friend staying with us, felt sick in the hotel and decided to go home. Since we will stay for 3 more days, we requested the hotel to clean the room... and the cleaner told us, he cant change the sheets, they dont change it. We again requested to apply detol to the cleaning material so that it will be sanitized, he said, go to reception, get sanitizer and thats it. \n\nIf you want your room to be sanitized, meaning even detol, you have to pay EXTRA.\nI thought it was MANDATORY for hotel rooms to be sanitized first because of COVID?\n\nAll in all, we check out and transferred to a different hotel. This is to give awareness to everyone who will check in. \n\nTo the management, I know the price is very low, but it is your responsibility and priority to ensure that your visitors are SAFE. I hope you will improve this for future travelers.",
