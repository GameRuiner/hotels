      "text": "Stayed at the Ketenci residence hotel for 2 days(1 night) on 21st of June. The hotel is a 15 minute stroll from Izmir bazaar, the rooms might seem a bit small for some people and are very clean and tidy, for us it was perfect and the food was excellent and the staff very efficient and friendly. You must remember that you are in Turkey so the food will be mainly Turkish orientated but I am sure the chef would be able to rustle something up to your liking as nothing seems to be too much trouble for them.All in all we had an excellent time there even though it was only for 1 night.",

      "text": "We booked this hotel as it had a Turkish bath, sauna and jacuzzi and want to have the hole treatment along with a massage. When we arrived no member of the staff spoke a word of English and after a struggle they let us know that all the facilities were out of order and they do not make appointments for massages during the weekend.\n  The room was quite small but OK. They had sprayed the room with a very heavy aroma and the bathrobe (yes they had only one) had a big hole on its sleeve.\nThe breakfast had a large variety of OLIVES !! .......and nothing else then some butter and marmalade.\nThe mini bar had expired drink in the fridge and when I took it down stairs to snow to the receptionist (could not explain in English as they don't understand) I could tell the 2 staff members were laughing about it like there was nothing wrong drinking something that was expired 5 months ago.",
