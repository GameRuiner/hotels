      "text": "stayed here one night in May. Really lovely place. the restaurant attached to the pension is a delight. Wonderful ambience, lovely food and the staff were so friendly, especially Ali, who is a total gentleman. The room was nicely decorated and comfortable with a large and very comfy bed. It is a pension, so amenities are somewhat basic, but it was nice and homely. The breakfast next morning was amazing - enough food for a day and all served with smiles. For anybody thinking of going to Sirince, I would certainly recommend this accomodation. Sirince itself is also a beautiful little village that is definitely worth a visit.",

The rooms are very traditional and charming and the food is wonderful provided by chef Mustafa! The village itself is beautiful and at night when the day trippers have gone home is so peaceful.
