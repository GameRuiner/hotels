      "text": "An absolute scam!! The room was not at all as described. I stayed in the private twin room and on the advert it states that it comes with a desk, seating area, fan and wardrobe. It had none of these except for the fan which did not work. The room just had 2 bunk beds and that was it! I had a private bathroom which was located outside my room which smelled like someone had been boiling cabbage, but that was the least of my worries. The door had a self locking system with keycard access and when closing that door from the outside, the handle would fall off, making it near impossible to close it. This would happen every time! Also, the restaurant does not serve half of what is on the menu. They claim to serve various meals, but in reality only serve pizza and sandwiches. When I raised these issues with the front desk, the guy working there just chuckled about it and with regards to the fan, told me that I wouldn’t need it as it doesn’t get that hot at night in Barcelona, which is beside the point; and with regards to the menu, he told me that because it is a hostel, it is not their responsibility to provide food for the guests. I’m sorry, but isn’t that the purpose of having a restaurant on site??? The biggest joke of them all? Quiet time - this is supposed to be between 0:00 and 7:00. Does anybody follow it? Do they heck! If anything, people are louder at that time. I could hear people partying, shouting, revving car and motorbike engines until well into the early hours of the morning, with nothing being done to stop them. And despite having a designated front desk, the reception is constantly moved to the restaurant, which is a real inconvenience to anyone who had to climb up the huge mountain to get to the property as you then have to walk further (not fun if you have heavy bags!). Also, the front desk being left unattended is a cause for concern as they have a till float behind there and it could get robbed. This company pride themselves in employing people with disabilities which is a good gesture, but they seem to also take advantage of them as I saw the same members of staff working long hours each day I was there. This property also does not respond to messages either as I complained to them after my stay to complain and they didn’t even respond! I am currently having to get in touch with Trading Standards in Spain to try to resolve this issue. This place definitely needs to be inspected and shut down ASAP!!!!",

As indicated in the description the private twin room has 2 bunk beds. \nWe have 24 hours recepction and a maintenance team that could have fixed your handle problem if you had told us at the front desk.\nIn the restaurant, in addition to pizzas and sandwiches, we serve: breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is a simple menu but we offer it daily, at the corresponding times.\nThe quiet time it´s from 00:00 to 7:00, which we rigorously respect by our clients and our neighbors, who value the tranquility of the Natural Park. Again we have reception 24 hours in case there is any issue.\n90% of our staff have some type of disability. The team works 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week with two consecutive days of weekly rest. At Inout Hostel there is no overtime work.\n\nThank you for your stay and for your comment, it helps us improve.\n",

Swimming pool and field to soccer and basketball was super for my children and us. Was also boars but not agresive. For us on the downside were night parties on the terrace. We were unlucky because the metro was closed for half of our stay and it took us an hour to get to the center of Barcelona. The next week it was only 20 minutes. The road to the hostel is uphill, it is difficult especially with heavy luggage. We will remember our stay at InOut well.",
