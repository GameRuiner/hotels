The front desk staffed were friendly and helped us with restaurant recommendations and how to find a nice food market 5 minutes away.  The location was extremely close to a Metro line which was great and  the area was quiet at night but not desolate.  Finally, the buffet breakfast at the hotel had many options and was tasty and well arranged.",
