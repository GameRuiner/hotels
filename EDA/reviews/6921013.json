The apartment was neat,bathroom needed to be updated,geyser never work properly,(had hot water just for 2 mins and when my spouse wanted to shower,water was cold) ,even though I called reception to check.  Nothing was done to fix the problem with geyser. The apartment was clean every day accept the bathroom sink wasn't cleaned\n\nThe reception, the two managers that were on duty was excellent with knowledgeof dubai,accept the ladies at reception,  which never either understand me or when I called from my room to say I can't  get hold of room services to send extra towels,nothing  was done. The ladies at reception need to go training on how to speak to guests of hotel as well as speak English. A little knowledge of Dubai ,could be helpful. \n\nA big thank you to Aslam Khan from the Travel agent at hotel premises, for his great assistance for organizing all of trips to see abu dhabi ,desert safari etc. \n\nThe staff and manager at the restaurant for breakfast were very friendly and especially to Laxman,a waiter,who knew what I drank every morning and served me with always a smile. Also to Glory and the other ladies, which I can't recall with names.,Well done!\n\nOverall I had a lovely stay at the hotel.A hotel that is central to Dubai Marina Mall,metro station,restaurants and supermarket etc",

The rooms are also quite nice and the apart-hotel style is useful for those who want to cook or wash clothes while on their journey (our room had a washing machine and kitchen). The staff was also extremely helpful and kind when I accidentally left some clothes in our room after checkout, keeping them in the lost and found for me until I realized that I had left items behind and promptly returning them to me when I returned for them.
