      "text": "Really enjoyed staying here for a week\nHotel staff are very friendly, smiling and helpful. \nA young woman called Thais was extra helpful, booking day trips for us and showing us where to go on the map and the metro. She always stopped to chat with us every time we entered or left the hotel. Always bright and smiling. üòÄ\nWe stayed in room 901 which is the pent house with plunge pool. \nThis room has sunshine on the balcony all day from sunrise to 6pm.üåû\nThe pool is freezing but would be nice on a hot summers day. Mu husband braved it once. Lol \nThe view of the mountain is lovely and the traffic noise level is less with it being so high up. \nWe got a complementary bottle of bubbly which was a nice touch ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nThere is a small fridge, kettle and nespresso machine which has complementary tea/coffee etc. \nPlus 2x bottled water in the fridge on arrival. \nThe room has a/c and a free safe in the wardrobe. \nThe bed is queen size, firm and very comfortable. \nThe shower has a large head and a separate hose with a large window so you can see the mountain while you shower lol \nThere are complimentary nail file, shower cap, toothbrushes, sewing kit, cotton buds, shampoo, shower gel, hand soap, hairdryer, robes and slippers. \nThe room is cleaned every day with fresh towels and bed changed. \nThe hotel is safe and secure! \nAccess is only through your keycard into the hotel and also the lift will only work with your keycard. \nReception is staffed 24/7\nStaff always greet you and ask about your day. \nBreakfast could do with being a bit better. More selection is needed. \nThe sausage are small tinned weiner/hot dog sausage. The bacon is smoked streaky with lots of fat. The baked beans are out on alternate days and only a small amount put out. The scrambled egg is great, but it's the only egg choice. The potato fritata is always cold. There is only 1 type of sliced bread. The mushrooms are awful, straight from the tin in water. The yoghurt selection is natural or lemon in a pot. Other flavours would be good. Fresh fruit of melon and orange is nice and the coffee machine is great. \nUs British love a fried breakfast and sadly we were disappointed with this, being as we paid extra per person per night. \nLate check out of 12pm was very good and Xavier was very helpful with checkout and luggage. We stored our luggage in a locked room with cctv until we needed it later for the airport. \nThere is a shop bang across the street open 24hrs for snacks, fresh fruit, toiletries and water. \nThe hotel is surrounded by bars and resteraunts with a metro station 1 or 2 blocks behind the hotel. \nTaxi drivers sit outside the hotel on the corner to the right and have a supplement of ‚Ç¨2-4 depending on the destination. Airport is ‚Ç¨4 supplement. \nTake a screenshot of the address for when you need to get a taxi and return to the hotel. \nBarcelona is huge and although we walked 20,000+ steps per day, we sometimes needed to get a taxi back, so having the address ready for the taxi driver helps them find the hotel. \nOverall we very much enjoyed this hotel and the wonderful team of staff.",

      "text": "Good distance from centre and most attractions. Staff were very friendly and provided information on transportation and recommendations for eating and the bus tour. The junior suite was very clean and fairly well maintained. The coffee machine/ kettle have to be moved to be able to plug them in! The bathroom has no door which was slightly strange. Plug heights were also unusual although plenty of them. Shower temperature was very temperamental. View from the balcony was great. ",
