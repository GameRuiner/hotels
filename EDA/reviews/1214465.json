The facilities are excellent including the pool, gym and restaurant where the food is superb, they even do a great bbq on a Saturday at the pool!! The staff are the hotels biggest asset.. Thanks to Preeti, Yu Yu and Amor at reception (amongst others), thanks also to the great restaurant and cleaning staff who looked after me & kept my room tidy (too many to name!!).. Looking forward to my next visit.",

It really is the small things like this that count. \nAll the staff have been lovely, our stay has been good. The pool is lovely and warm as it is heated and everywhere is clean.",
