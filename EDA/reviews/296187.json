That’s it.\nNow the bad points\nThe breakfast\n\nWe have eaten in hotels in most of the world but never had a breakfast so poor. For the price of the hotel most was on inedible. We had melon that had  been set out the previous day and was just a ball of mess. The boiled eggs were either under or over cooked. The word “inedible” covers the breakfast best.\nThe bar prices.\nMy partner ordered two drinks, and when we paid the bill at the end, the cost was €36. No it wasn’t top end champagne but spirit and mixer!\nA beautiful old buildings spoiled by greed.\nIf you can get a nice room at a good price then eat out and you may be a happy bunny.",

      "text": "Gorgeous hotel surrounded by greenery that makes you feel as if you’re in a Boutique hotel in Italy. A perfect swimming pool to relax, and three lovely restaurants (Italian/Turkish and Tapa). It’s a very chilled stay seconds from amazing nightlife filled with rows of bars. Breakfast was simple but had plenty to choose from. The only negative was the actual prices to drink in the hotel was very steep. We ordered two beers at pool which came to £14, we’re as any bar was no more\nThan £3. So if you want to relax at the pool bring your own carry out. We definitely will return. ",

      "text": "When we first arrived everything seemed good even if the taxi driver did not know where to take us. We drove around for approximately 2 hours until the driver said that he will just leave us in the street because he cannot drive thus to narrow streets. thank good we demanded him to look for an other taxi, at last when arrived at the hotel, it was difficult to see the desk.\n\nWe had planned a week of holiday to celebrate finishing radiation therapy. Everything had went okay until my husband showered one morning and slipped, he fell down to the floor, he tried to support his fall but crashed into the left wardrobe door leaving a small crack in the plywood door.\n\nMy husband went to the check in desk and told what happened. the man at the desk told my husband not to worries, since these doors only look expensive but are cheap fake. this man, working for the hotel (he also checked us in to the hotel upon arrival) said to my husband that the cost is going to be approximately 190 Turkish Lira (6,59 €).\n\nMy husband wanted to pay immediately, but the man at the desk said to pay at check out. We accepted this without thinking that they would hustle us.\n\nNext day, the manager of the hotel comes to us to tell us that we need to sort this broken door matter. my husband and I went to talk with the manager and they would fix the doors and call a repairman.\n\nLater the manager came to us again and said that we need to pay for the broken door now and that it cannot wait (we were leaving in 2 days). We went to the reception desk and all of the sudden the price had changed from 190 Turkish lira to 190 Euro!!!!! This means that in turkish lira we paid 5474,24.\n\nThis was a RIPOFF!!  \n\nthey fixed both doors on that wardrobe and replaced the plywood doors with mirror glass doors.\n\nI asked the manager what the h*ll but as a woman I was not in the position to negotiate with him.  I was just angry on how manager says that the doors were expensive and old while his employee says that they are not and i can see that it is plywood. Secondly the manager says that they paid the repairman in cash and that it was expensive to get him to the hotel.\n\nin reallity: This repair man had been sleeping near the hotel the whole week and I do not believe that they paid him over 5000 liras. They had also \"fixed2 the small closet for the minibar (see pictures how fixed), this indicates more to my truth, thay fix it cheap and take everything they can get..\n\nI would like to recommend this hotel because of the location and price, but I cannot. The rooms were dirty (no vacuuming, ever? and a lot of dust everywhere) and I cannot get over this massive rip off. I will never visit this hotel again.",
