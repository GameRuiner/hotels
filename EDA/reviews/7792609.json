Good has been great, especially the Italian and Egyptian restaurants which were outstanding, the buffet has also been great for all three meals. \n\nSadly the only downside has been a small minority of very loud, inconsiderate Brits who complain about everything, row loudly at each other and reserve sunbeds for hours without actually using them. \n\nWe would absolutely recommend the hotel, it is lovely and our family swim up was absolutely perfect for us with plenty of shade in the afternoons and a lovely view across Makadi and the Red Sea.",

Loads for the family to do as it has a massive water park, big main pool and a beach which is a short bus ride away.\nThere is an adults only area on the roof above the main restaurant and you can visit one of the themed restaurants on the complex, one per stay think there’s about seven different ones to chose from. You can also pay for them if you want to go again, it’s not to expensive we done the pan Asian twice, the Italian twice and the Indian once, would highly recommend them all. The hotel is really nice, the rooms could do with a bit of updating but you don’t spend too much time in the room anyway. The staff here are brilliant and try their best to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.",

      "text": "Wonderful trip taken end March with our family- 40+ couple, father, two teens and a 4 year old! There was something for everyone. The staff were all lovely and great entertainers of the young and old 🤣, the hotel very clean, sleek and welcoming, the waiting staff and food options superb and the facilities throughout the resort all fantastic. The a la carte was difficult to book in to but guest relations helped and we eventually got there! \nThe water park was great and amused all our family, even our difficult 4 year old, the beach was fabulous - once we figured out where we were going! The pools - just wow- we especially liked the area near the Viva bar. We never managed to acquire sunbeds around the main pool, but didn’t really mind- there’s so much space else where. \nOur excursions were all out of this world and the staff on them second to none too! Pool side staff very careful regarding safety and not allowing any unruliness - which was a refreshing change, although the families visiting were all generally lovely with very kind and courteous children with our youngest (especially German 🇩🇪 children). \nOverall a superb trip we were all sad to leave; our littlest wanted to “stay on my holiday forever”.\n\nA few tips- \n• Politeness to the staff is not unnoticed and they appreciate a smile and a thank you!! (Note- don’t be entitled rude beasts!) \n•Tip small but often, pounds, dollars and euros are widely accepted and the cash machines outside dispense Egyptian pounds. Take pound coins for when you first arrive- especially for the airport and transfer.\n•The usual reserving of beds is an issue, but the pool team do go above and beyond to try to help and there are so many areas to relax, not just the main pool area.\n•If you have any issues- talk to the staff- they will do absolutely anything to help. \n•On most trips there is photography- the cost varies between 35 and 70 euros and you don’t find out on the cost until the end of the trip! It’s rare that you’ll see the images beforehand (although we did on the scuba trip), so don’t rely on these as your images if you don’t want to pay these prices! \n\nWe really hope to return in the near future. Thank you team Jaz Aquaviva for a fantastic stay, special mention to Ahmed in housekeeping, Ahmed in waiting service and the head chef/management in the food court!",
