Everyday I was at reception asking for recommendations for places to eat and things to do. They bent of backwards to help us, made some amazing recommendations and made all the phone calls always with a smile!!! I will definitely stay here again because of the lovely staff, highly recommend!",

Nice touches: glass of cava on arrival, turn down service. Attic rooms have a lovely balcony to get away from the sight seeing. Lovely area. Great bars and restaurants a-plenty near by. Bed, beautifully comfortable! Don’t believe the reviews slating breakfast - loads of choice and lots of local specialities. Appreciated the contact from the experience team before and during stay - it seems to matter to this hotel that guest have a good time. Hope to come back one day and would recommend very highly…",

It is a pleasure to read you have had a perfect stay with us.  We have taken good note of your feedback regarding the breakfast service and we will look into this together with the team of Xerta Restaurant.  Regarding our pool.  Normally it is heated but due to the drought in Catalunya we are not allowed to re-fill the pool-.  Heating the pool would make the water evaporate faster, so we had to stop heating.  We hope the situation will turn around soon.  We hope to be able to welcome you back, in the meantime we remain at your entire disposal.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYves \nHotel Manager\n",
