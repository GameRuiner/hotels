      "text": "When we arrived. the receptionist gave us our room card on time, maybe 5 minute later.\nThe room was clean. but didn't the same as the image we saw on the sites. room 618\n\nWe chose this hotel for 2 reason. save budget, because we spent most of our time out of the hotel. we used the hotel just for sleep and breakfast. the other reason was  we wanted the hotel to be near the subway station. this hotel was near the al-rigga station. you need to walk 5 minutes to get to the station.\nfrom this hotel, if you want take a taxi and go to the Burj Khalifa, it's cost you 34 AED.\n\nWiFi speed was good. you should change WiFi connection on every floor.\n\nThe staff was good. but the manager, he was very angry :) I don't know why!. also receptionist was a good man :)\n\nThe problem was the bathroom. we hadn't hot water at all. I said this problem to the receptionist, but they did nothing.\nBreakfast was not good. there was no variety. there was not enough light in the breakfast room. and the biggest problem was, mosquitoes and beetles in the breakfast room.\n\nOverall I do not recommend this hotel.\n",
