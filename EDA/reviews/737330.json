      "text": "We stayed in Parkim Ayaz for 3 nights and I must say that the hospitality of the staff working there was amazing. It‚Äôs a good option for families with kids. The hotel is on the beach with unlimited options for food and drinks.\nI also tried the salon & spa inside the hotel. I did highlights for my hair and did blow dry twice. The lady there is absolutely professional and did a great job with my hair Color and highlights. I would definitely recommend her.\nWe also did a photoshoot with Serkan the photographer inside the hotel and he also was extremely professional and did a great job with our pictures. \nOverall a good experience for us except the pools were too cold to enjoy but again that was because it was early April.",

      "text": "Parkim Ayaz is an absolutely beautiful hotel, we booked 7 days and we leave tomorrow so I thought I'd write an honest review!! The destination is perfect and beautiful it's paradise to look at whether you're sat by one of the pools or looking out from your apartment it is just bliss!! We had a room with one double and a single all though they are small they are immaculate, shower is lovely and you're never to far from a bar or food! I've read reviews before I came and people moaned about the food we've had nothing but lovely food plenty of meats,  fresh salad and loads of variety every day! Snack bar is lovely 2-6 perfect and you can take this food out at this time(only time you can do this) waffles and ice cream for the kids is brilliant aswell! restaurant and bar staff lovely and very attentive and helpful! Now for the entertainment team Ahmet and his team are absolutely amazing and kept us laughing and entertained every day and night from aqua gym, pool volley ball to excellent entertainment at night time!!! I would fully recommend this hotel to anyone and we will 100 percent be returning!! if I had one negative thing to say if u can class it as that, it would be (and this is mine and my family's preference) there is no fresh fruit as in watermelon etc. but they had apples etc so not really a complaint just a personal opinion!! hotel great all staff great and this had been one of our best holidays so far!! 10 out of 10 to parkim ayaz hotel and every single member of staff to your smashing it and you deserve all the praise and recognition you can get well done and thankyou .. üåû‚õ±Ô∏èüå¥üíÉüç∏‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞",
