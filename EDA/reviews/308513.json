A good location only 15 minute walk from the metro but also supporting staff will find you taxi ride in a minute.\nBreakfast enough choices, and replenished all the time.\nAlso good services where we were able to borrow swimming pool towels to use on the beach! Only thing I would mention is that the walls are thin and you can hear a lot from outside in the corridors. This was an issue with other guests allowing their children to run around during the early morning which made sleeping past 7:30-8am every morning an issue. I’m sure this doesn’t happen all the time otherwise we have nothing to fault during our stay.",
