Clean and 4 beds. Near the house, there are old bazaar, clock tower, the beach, and the metro. Especially, the hosts were so nice. They told us which place to go in Izmir. \nWe had a car accident in Izmir and they helpe us with everything. Speaking with the police, rental car company, everthing. I would definitely stay again if I come to Izmir again. ",
