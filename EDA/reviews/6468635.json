Alsancak is middle of Izmir and this hotel is middle of Alsancak. Close to everywhere. Rooms and facilities getting older but service is improving each year. I would like to thank them exceptional service. Specially night reception who organised my medicene purchase from sentry drug store with a taxi cap driver. I did not move what i wanted delivered to my room in the middle of night. Another special thanks to an old gentelmen who organises breakfast and whatch over guest if they are satisfied with service and everything. He is really watching over guests if they need anything and try to please you. I dont know his name but a true customer oriented person congrats..  it s not a fancy hotel but quality is really good.
