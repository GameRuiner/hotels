      "text": "We stayed two days together with my fiancee. The reason for our stay is that we can do the wedding event on the terrace of the hotel, so we stayed for trial purposes. Price for wedding organization. After half an hour passed, the manager of the hotel tried to increase the price. The event manager and hotel manager are trying to deceive the customers by calling each other by phone. An example of a disgusting personality and a disgusting business. My advice to you is to stay away. Regarding hotel rooms, I would not recommend staying on the 7th floor. Because the terrace does not have its own elevator and the people who came to the event get on and off the 7th floor, and there was an incredible noise. They couldn't even think of appointing an officer. A bulging for those who are considering holding their event here. See your cocktail menus in real. Incredibly funny few treats. The price they ask for these treats is unbelievably high.",

      "text": "Pros:\nLocation of the hotel is perfect! Right next to Pasaport Pier for the ferry, short walk to Konak in one direction and Alsancak in the other. Waterfront property but entrance is on main street behind. Closest metro stop is Çankaya very easy to find hotel from there. Rooms super clean and spacious and comfy bed. Staff extremely helpful and kind. Have good advice on where to eat. I recommend Topçu just across the road! Due to ongoing building work and as they were full, they offered us a free late check out on our last day as we had a late flight. Would come back again next time I am in Izmir for sure!!!\n\nCons:\nNot much I can say that I didn't like. Many channels on TV but none in English. Plug in the Jacuzzi didn't fit properly so had to keep foot on it to stop water draining. *only relevant if you are staying here very soon from now (end of sept to start of Oct) not sure how long it will last but there is renovations going on on 7th floor it's been completely ripped out. Lots of noise with drilling and hammering etc. We spoke to reception staff who got the workers to not start until after 10am.",

      "text": "Pictures looked better then real life. The carpet in the room looked like it had better days cream isn’t a great colour for a hotel. However the cleaners during the week did a good job at tidying up.\nLovely big windows in room. Heating worked well. Only one lift so you had to wait quite a while sometimes.\nWIFI worked well enough for my chrome stick. The room bed and bathroom were a decent size plenty of room. \nHave to walk a while to get to any tube station but we got a taxi to Alsancak lots of stuff there was about 10 tl per way. You can walk to the see front and pier in a matter of seconds was refreshing. \nOver all wouldn’t stay there again defiantly needs refurbishing but was okay for a few nights. Staff were friendly water was replenished in the fridge in the room everyday. ",
