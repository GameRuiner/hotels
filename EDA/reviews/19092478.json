      "text": "I would not recommend this hotel for a tourist break to Barcelona. The pool was closed and it is too far from main tourist area. On arrival I had to pay €150 deposit, I’m used to just leaving my card details. The pool and the surrounding sun-bed area were closed, I believed this was due to the 3 year drought and government orders. However, a woman on our guided tour assured me her roof top pool was open. If I were to return to Barcelona I would definitely choose a hotel closer to La Rambla. There are, of course, restaurants and cafes close to the hotel but many of the recommended ones are over half an hours walk away, (we loved our food and the ambiance of the Cellarer Wine Bar, only 16 min walk away). La Sagrada Familia is 20 min walk away, winding streets of the Gothic Quarter over 30 min walk away and the beach 55min. The Passeig de Gràcia metro station is about 15min walk away, from there you will get a train directly to Terminal 2 at the airport (they run every 30mins, €5 each, about €32 via Uber). The rooms were nicely styled, clean and quiet. Our 4  teabags, 2 coffee pods and drinking water were replaced daily (local shops don’t put prices on the water which we found suspicious). The tables in the beautiful hotel lobby were occupied by many people on laptops and I imagine this is a popular hotel for conferences.",

      "text": "Stayed 5 nights in March and was completely blown away. \n\nThe hotel is perfectly located with easy access to a train station that will take you to all the main sites, as well as walking distance to great museums, shopping and restaurants. The staff were all lovely and helpful.\n\nThe room was very comfortable and spacious, as well as beautifully decorated. Everything was clean and well presented. The wifi was fast and we had no issues streaming. The bathroom was also clean, well laid out and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic. \n\nI wouldn't stay anywhere else if I was returning to Barcelona.",
