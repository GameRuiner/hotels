      "text": "The hotel is badly situated, badly maintained, and smells of cigarette and sewage. The carpets in the corridors and in the room have plenty of bleach stains and holes. \nThe swimming pool and outside area are dirty and badly maintained. \nAs someone wrote in their guest book, the perfect place for a murder movie. \n\nThe room is dark, there is not enough lights (just two small lampshades). Luckily we didn’t need to work in this room. There were broken things in the bathroom, and the shower was not good. \nThe bed is OK and big but they don’t put top sheets, just a bed cover. \n\nThe breakfast was OK; the lobby is OK. \nThe staff is friendly and helpful but most of them don’t speak other languages apart from Turkish. \n\n",

There is a strong smell of smoke in the room and the  corridor.the pool also needs refurbishment and the parasols have holes in it. Upon discovering all this we decided to change our booking from 3 nights to one. The staff refused to do it and said it was not posible. We ended up doing it ourselves through the booking agent. At check out they tried to charge us twice for the room despite us showing that the money had been taken from our bank account.",

      "text": "We stayed here for just one night to attend a concert at nearby Forum Bornova. It is a typical corporate 4* hotel with appropriate 4* facilities. The main problem for many would be the location within the grounds of the University Hospital as access to other transport such as Bornova metro and buses is a 1km walk back to the hospital main entrance (the pedestrian access to the forum has recently been closed off). The desk staff were most efficient and helpful during check in and when requesting information.\nOur high floor non-smoking, front facing room had view over the pine woods, Forum Bornova and the city, rooms at the rear face the hospital. Comfortable twin beds and a large modern bathroom and all the expected facilities of a 4* hotel.\nA good breakfast was provided in the airy dining room with plenty of options, fruit, cereals, pastries as well as the expected Turkish fare. In all we had a pleasant stay.",

      "text": "Anemon Ege Saglik is off the main ring road about 30 mins from the airport and next to the large Bornova shopping centre. It is a short taxi ride to the city centre. I stayed here for the convenience of the location near major roads as it was just the stop on a journey, but finding the hotel was difficult as neither Google maps or my Sat Nav had the position of the hotel correct. The hotel is on the university campus next to the large hospital. My room at the front overlooked pine woods but at the back the view is to the hospital.\n   The hotel is clean and comfortable with large rooms typical of modern corporate hotels. It has the business rooms and large restaurant as expected.There was plenty of choice at breakfast. Staff were friendly and it was surprisingly quiet given the position although some door banging could be heard in my room near the lifts.\nGood value for this type of hotel. Parking on site and railings to which to chain the motorbike. Easy walk to several cafes with cheap eats. Outside pool and garden overlooked by this large hotel.\nOK for a stop over or for visiting the hospital but not somewhere for a relaxing holiday.",
