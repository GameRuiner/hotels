In our establishment there is always one person on guard (at least). If you seem to have contracted a non-refundable fee under your responsibility and were unable to travel, you cannot blame the establishment of your purchasing decision. If you have really suffered a disease, you will have an insurance fund which will be able to pay you back the lost money.
