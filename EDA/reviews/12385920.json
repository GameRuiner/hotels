There is a terasse on the roof, with view over the city and the sea (perfect for breakfast :) ). The appartement is perfectly clean, and everything is provided. Taner, the Host of this appartement is amazing, not only as a host, but he also impressed us, as a person. He was always very uncomplicated and flexibel with everything we needed. He always took the time to sit down with us and explain everything, giving us the best advices on how and where to enjoy Izmir, places you can only find through locals. Normally we travel really fast, trying to see as many places in the shortest amount of time, but Izmir and the way we felt in this appartment convinced us within hours to extand our originally one night stay to a three night stay. To just enjoy our selves, because it really just felt good beeing there. The appartement is a little bit more expensive than some of the other options in Izmir, but it is worth it in so many ways.",

      "text": "We were traveling with friends and we split the downstairs apartment - perfect for a group or two couples/families traveling together. Both rooms were equally nice. \nThe property was beautifully and historically restored. There is a private courtyard and a rooftop terrace with an incredible view of Izmir bay. We were welcomed warmly, given a lovely tour, and the owner was always available. (Especially when we managed to lock ourselves out of our room but into the courtyard while having a pizza delivered! On that note, everything is very secure - multiple gates and locks and doors between you and your stuff and the world.) \n\nSome things to know before you book: there are two floors and since it is an historic house, you can hear some noise from the upstairs while you are in the downstairs. This would really only be a problem if you are VERY sensitive to footsteps or if you and the upstairs folk are on different schedules. If that's the case, I recommend you book the upstairs room and not the downstairs apartment. \n\nThe surrounding roads are very steep. If you rent a car, be prepared to face the challenge of squeezing through a narrow lane on a VERY steep grade. There is gated parking available, but if you aren't comfortable with tight turns, I wouldn't take it! \n\nThere was (at least when we were there) a group of dogs we nicknamed the Konak Gang. They were very friendly, but they had an ongoing gang war each night. Bring earplugs if you aren't used to sleeping through bursts of dogs barking right outside your window.\n\nOverall we had a pleasant stay - the owner is lovely, the home is lovely, the location is not in a touristy area and is convenient to making day trips to Ephesus or local attractions, and the views are SO worth it.",
