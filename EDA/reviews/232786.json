      "text": "They say you get what you pay for and whilst Hotel Viladomat might be considered budget. I've stayed in better budget hotel chain in the UK and central europe that offered more than Viladomat did. The location is great as its pretty central and close to Bus an tube links. If you'e just looking for somewhere to crash and leave your bags then maybe this i\"Hotel\" is for you. But for a family of three who'd booked two rooms it felt a bit like we were being ripped off. There are no tea making facilties in the rooms you have t go down to the rather uninviting lounge area which  feels more like a college empty cafteria. It has a bar which isnt a bar because they don't serve drinks. You can get breakfast in the mornings but we didn't we bought some food from a locla super market as we were only there for four days. There are also quite a few cafes close to the hotet if you want to get your own breakfast all reasonably priced.\nThe hotel  - some were very helpful and welcoming others were exceedingly unhelpful and in come cases very stand offish. Its called a hotel and they do have other sites but it was more like a glorified hostel than hotel. And even in a hostel you can get complimentary tea coffee and water. Viladomat you have to pay and its from a dispensing machine.\nIf we'd been staying longer we would have left and asked the holiday company for out money back as its misrepresenting itself as there is an inference that this Hotel offers more than you actually get and its not an unreasonable interpritation from a prospective guest.\n\nYou could see the wear and tear in our room the bidet was cracked and there was chipped tiles. Our room becsue wanted a double bed not two singles placed together was on the small side with little light as it onlu had one very small window.\nAccess to electrical points was poor only on one side of the  bed. Given that these days most people have electronic devices phones, watches, air pods, tablets, etc and if you're a couple you'd want to be able to charge up and place your items on the bedside cabinet. But one of you will have to run a cable from the opposite wall to the bed. There was no draw space and no suite case rack Very few coat hangers given that there were two of us\n\nEven if you wanted to relax in the lounge area becuase it looks and feels so uninviting and more like a college cafe we didn't. Nothing was really explained to us when w checked in except making sure we paid the tax.\n\nOn the plus side the rooms were clean.\nIt was centrally located and there were plenty of cabs that you can hail (freenow)\nOn the first day not long after we'd landed we took a took took ride aroud the city which was great to get your bearings, see the  sights in general take pictures \nWe went to the Picasso Musem a must but do book in advance and note that the museum is closed on a Monday. \nWe took a ride on the Mountjuic Cable car (becareful there are two cable cars) -  the Monjtuic one is a seated ride,  the other one you have to stand.\nWe didnt pay to go into the castle at the top we just strolled  a little way around the grounds. \nWe also took a cab to the beach even though it was a rainy day (our last) just for the view and a change of scenery. \nWe didnt pay to go into Sagarda Familia  on advice from friends who been before they said it wasn't worth the entry price circa 30-40 euros pp. We just looked from the front and took pictures. \nWe fond some great places to eat including Indian Bambi  but the greates find was My Way in the centre a restaurant/bar which was just a real delight and extrnely good value for money.\n\nLike I said we've stayed in budget hotel chains that offer more and cost less for the equivalent three nights.\nWhen we return, which we will do for longer; if we stay in the city we'd like to stay in the same area but we'll be booking into a hotel that has room service, a bar and a restaurant. Yes it will cost more but in the long run it will be worth it.",
