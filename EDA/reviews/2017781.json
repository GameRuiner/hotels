      "text": "Currently sat here on the beach on our last day writing my review. \n\nWe stayed on a Premium All Inc basis in a villa with swim up pool, which was a great size for 4 of us. \n\nPositives:\nThe staff are a credit to the hotel and definitely make it 5 star, we did not meet one that did not go above and beyond. \n\nThe Atrium app is great, you can also order drinks and food from your lounger. On the beach it was an average 3 minutes service which was great.\n\nThe quality of cocktails is great with a very good selection of premium branded drinks.\n\nFood was always very good, good selection and different every day. The A la Carte option was a nice addition and we ate from this a couple of nights. We also ate at the Greek and Italian. Both also very good quality and delicious. We particularly enjoyed the tiramisu! \n\nNegatives:\nAnts in bathroom and on patio, although I guess this is a byproduct of a hot country (although not experienced as many in Cyprus) \n\nVilla Pool was not heated even though it said it was.\n\nLocation is a little remote but handy bus service a short walk from the hotel. This wasn’t an issue for us but we do like a walk on an evening.\n\nAll in all we have had a great holiday. Rhodes is a beautiful island, and if you are thinking of booking - do it.",

A special shout out to Captains Michaelis and Anastasia, bar staff; Cristos, Vasillis, aka Billy, Blevins and the bar manager! We can’t name you all, however everyone is a credit to the management of Atrium Hotels! The food is excellent, we especially enjoyed the Asian speciality restaurant which we visited twice as part of our all inclusive upgrade. The buffet for both breakfast and dinner is extensive and it was a pleasant surprise to be able to order a main meal from a menu in the main dining room. The cocktails made by the pool bar team were excellent and the service was again first class, made very easy by being able to order poolside drinks and snacks using the App. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and the beds are exceptionally comfortable. Given it was late season, and lower occupancy, we benefited from having a choice of sunbed each day and enjoyed a very relaxed atmosphere. The weather was on our side too! Thank you again for your hospitality and I will certainly recommend the Atrium\nPlatinum to colleagues and friends.",
