      "text": "Mare Nostrum Hostal was a perfect stay for me.  The location is midway down La Rambla only steps away from Metro station and bus stop. Views from the room provided endless people-watching entertainment. The desk staff was welcoming and helpful, the housekeepers were thorough, the breakfast host was cheerful and provided fine food service every day.  The Hostal is convenient, kept very clean, is a good value and is a comfy place to rest after days of travel and sightseeing. The Old Town proximity gave one easy access to explore Barri Gotiq, El Born, Raval neighborhoods. The large market, La Boqueria, is only a block away.  \n\nAs a senior traveler, I was a bit apprehensive about the stairs from ground level to first floor and elevator but they turned out not to be a big problem for me.  Mare Nostrum is an old building, but nicely renovated.  The only thing I wished for was a grab bar in the shower, to lend a feeling of greater security.\n\nMare Nostrum was a delightful place to stay for my first visit to Barcelona.  It will be my first choice when I return to this wonderful city.  Please check out the Mare Nostrum website as it informs about the management's ecological, environmental and humanitarian programs/concerns supported by their business. ",

Our 1st room was so small we could not open our suitcases on the floor.  When closed the suitcases had to go into the bathroom or between the single beds.  Very unhappy, I addressed the person at the checkin desk.  When advised we would be checking out in the morning and I wanted a refund.  That person immeciately found a larger room for us.  We accepted and stayed the 5 days.  Having said that.  There are NO amenities. I had to go to a neighborhood bar to obtain ice for drinks, bath towles are small and very well worn.  You will climb 2 flights of stairs to get to check in counter.  Staff was friendly and helpful.\nIf you are a single person and on a budget, this could be the place for your stay. If you are 2 people, be sure you don't get placed in the cramped rooms.",
