C Central Hotel did not inform us before arrival that there are two huge constructionsites right next to the hotel.\n\nWhat a big surprise when we arrived here after our flight from germany. This insane noise from 8am to 6pm made it impossible to relax at the beach. We complained but they didnt accept cancellation. After a while they sent us to a partner hotel for the daytime to find relaxationtime at another beach. We had to pay the taxi of course.Breakfast and Dinner was alright but in compare to other hotels and for this price under expectations.Rooms have not be cleaned properly before we arrived. Some black hairs between our white towels were disgusting. Balcony door could not be closed properly, so again the constructionsites were loud and annoying.We are really disappointed of the service we experienced. Every guest should be properly informed about the real conditions on site.",
