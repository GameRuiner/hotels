We never used it.\nOn the minus side, the rooms are dated. Breakfast is the same every day. No slippers in the room. We asked for and never received them. We were 3 guests and only got 2 bath towels and one hand towel. We asked for more they provided but the next day we only got 2 clean ones.\nWe tried the buffet dinner once and weren't impressed by the taste.\nThere's nothing you can do in the proximity, so you'll always have to grab a taxi or use the crowded metro to get somewhere.\n",
