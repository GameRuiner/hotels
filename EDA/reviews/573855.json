Until now we believed the Park Hyatt in Shanghai to be the best,however we have found the Park Hyatt Dubai to be in a class of its own.\nThe hotel and its facilities are simply superb. \nThis is matched by really an amazing staff. We have only experienced this level of service in Mauritius. \nWe cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We should add a special thanks to Manuel and Miguel whoâ€™s efforts left nothing to chance \n\nGeoff and Mary near Birmingham England",
