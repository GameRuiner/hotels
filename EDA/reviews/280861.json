These were not replaced on 2nd day of stay which was disappointing. \nThe fridge was ok in the room and 2 single beds which were a bit hard... appreciate that each person is different  ..\nThe reason for the rating is that housekeeping  bleached clothing of my husbands and although the reception staff took photos,  nothing was done about it. An email address was given to me that bounced back!!!!! So I messaged hotel directly and yet again no reply..\nReally poor customer service and care  ...\nBasically didn't give a toss and bluffed us onto the manager.   Still waiting for a response...\nNot a cheap hotel but would have expected better customer service..",
