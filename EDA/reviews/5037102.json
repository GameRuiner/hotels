      "text": "Baity Hotel Appartment In Mankhool  Kuwaiti street is a perfect place to stay in Dubai.  It is close to the center, Metro and  Airport The rooms was very pleasant, it was cozy and clean. Breakfast was excellent and incredibly varied. The hotel team has always been friendly, patient and helpful. That impressed me the most. No matter what time of day or night, you could turn to them with all your concerns. On my next stays, I will definitely check into this Hotel Appartment  The price performance ratio is very good. Great Thanks to Mr. Nilesh and support",
