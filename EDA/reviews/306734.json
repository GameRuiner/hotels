      "text": "Terrible experience from the get-go! The lady wearing glasses at the reception, while checking didn’t even pay attention to our requests, but gave a thorough treatment to the lady standing behind us in the line. We arrived at noon with two little kids (2 and 1 year old) requested a crib for our, but since nobody really cares, we’ve got it only around 11pm at night after numerous phone calls and visits to the reception.\n\nAlso stay away from the steak/bar place near the reception, although we had all-inclusive package the hostess stopped us from entering and said she’d first double check “if we really have all inclusive for our kids” before we are allowed to be served, what nonsense and disrespect. But that wasn’t the worst part about this bar, the same night when we were in our room, around 11pm we started receiving phone calls from this place, same lady was calling and demanding that we come down and pay(were still not sure what we were supposed to pay for), we kindly asked her to meet in the morning as our kids were being put asleep. Few minutes she started calling again,and woke up the children. It a was super UNPLEASANT experience.\n\nStay away and remember all-inclusive is not really including everything!!!",

Charming people indeed looked after us so well. \n\nHotel great for travelling with 3 teenagers The Underground Pub showing live football.  Restaurants great food and staff again lovely. \n\nBeach area was nice and watersports next door. \n\nOnly downside was cranes and building work going on which did spoil our view and could be noisy. Obviously this won’t be forever, so would recommend to people with teenagers music was up to date and constant at the pool which we liked but appreciate not for everyone.   \n\nSa",
