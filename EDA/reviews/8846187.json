      "text": "Excellent location with a great value! The driver they arranged for airport pick up was flawless and so appreciated after 25 hrs flying from US. Well worth a few more dollars than waiting for a taxi or Uber. Huge clean quiet room with kitchenette that I didn't use. I was aware no onsite restaurant as everything is literally out your door inc their sister hotel with restaurant or other suggestions. Check in with front desk was a breeze and very friendly staff going the extra mile to provide a quiet room for me to get much needed sleep before boarding cruise ship and assist with bags and taxi's. Seawalk across the street and Las Ramblas and Gothic Quarter just a few blocks away. No reason to go elsewhere. This will be my go to BCN pre-cruise hotel going forward. ",
