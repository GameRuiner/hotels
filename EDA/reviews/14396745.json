On the maintenance front the shower was supposed to be waterfall-type but the shower head was damaged and water just poured everywhere, all over the floor.  Once the cleaning had been carried out it was acceptable, but there are problems that bed sheets are too small and there is not enough cutlery to use.",

      "text": "Me and my boyfriend had an early booking for 7 days in this hotel. When we arrived to the hotel we were given the room that was no more than 10sq m size together with tiny bathroom. On the site it was listed as 20 sq.m. No mini kitchen, no sitting area, no space at all. Just the bed to jump on right after you get inside the room. The bathroom widths is less than a metre, you just knock off the walls and corners your elbows all the time. Bed was so close to one of the walls that barely a foot could fit in that space. Not possible to get up from that side of the bed even for a child without smashing of the wall. All the rooms that you see on the site do exist, but this tiny room was definitely for one person only and most likely for no longer than one night stay. Room wasn't cleaned even once during our stay, though we asked for it. Next to us bigger room had guests changed all the time, cleaned every two days. When we asked to change the room, we were told we can do it on the 4th day of our stay with extra pay. Site mentions that staff is multilingual. Not a single person speaks other language than Turkish. When you talk on the reception that room size doesn't match with the info on the site, they blame the site. When you explain that early booking for a longer period of stay should be considered and staff should make people comfortable during their stay in this hotel, they complaint that you are the one who made the booking for this room, so what's your problem. Stating that booking was done for the room that is listed on the site and not the one that was given in the hotel, doesn't lead anywhere. Staff just don't care. I'm attaching some photos of the room.\n\nApart from that, the street where hotel is, is quite 'surprising'... The moment you make a right turn from the hotel on the next street to reach the seaside, you get on the street with transgenders/prostitutes trying to pick you up, giving some sort of comments all the time, etc. And that's only 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel to kordon to one direction, and same walking distance to the train station. Yes, this is a city center, but that was just sort of a shock to go through that kind of the street every single day and see those people in amount of at least 3 'working'. I haven't seen in any comment saying that the hotel is located in such 'lovely' neighbourhood, so decided to write about it just for people to know.",

      "text": "I had a reservation through hotels.com for an economic room. I *already* had paid. I went to *the* reception *at* around 15.00. They *told me my* room number, then I went to *the* room. But *when I got into the room I saw that the room was under construction! The *repairperson* told me to wait at *the* reception in *in* impolite *manner*.\n\nNormally the *the check-in time was* 14.00. *Before my arrival I even called the hotel to tell that I would arrive at 15.00.* But despite that they *did not* the room ready *on time*. When I went to the reception, I *told* them that I did not want to wait anymore. But *I still* had to wait 15 *more* minutes. Then they told me to go to a lodging house in some other place because they did not have any *vacant* economic rooms. And they said: \"If you pay 50 liras more, you can stay in our bigger rooms.\" *I told them I had a reservation and asked why I should pay again. I said that they should provide me an economic room since I had a reservation for one and not then they should give me another room without any charge and if those options were not available then they should book me a room in another hotel and not in a lodging house.* But *they kept insisting. They told me I did not have the right to demand such things. They even went so far trying to humiliate me with the following questions:* \"Are you staying for *the* first time in a hotel? We did not have any trouble before. It is first time with you.\"\n\nThis shows how they approach situations like this. Then I called hotels.com customer service. They helped me. *The* customer service asked them to give *an* alternative room in Ada Apart Hotel or to book *a room* in *another* hotel, not *in a lodging house*. Then *this* hotel *all of a sudden magically offered me an economic room which supposedly they did not have a few minutes ago :) *Then they asked for the room fee which I had already had paid online.* I told them I already paid for the room online and told them I did not want to call the customer service again.* Then they stopped asking *for* the money. \n\nAt last, at 16.30, I could enter my room. I rely and thank hotels.com customer service. *Apart from I wrote here so far*, I *encountered other* problems. The space near the toilet was very tiny. The shower had a half door. While having *a* shower, everywhere was getting wet in *the* bathroom. Hot water was not always *available*.\nIn the end, i don't *recommend* this hotel for sure. They are rude, they *do not care about* customers. They only care *about* money. Please stay away from that hotel!",
