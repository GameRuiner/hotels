They made our stay so enjoyable and comfortable.\n\nI would like to thank all the team! Especially  Mr TULSI ( house keeping) and ABHISHEK ( Hotel entrance ) they do their job perfectly. Thank you again for the warm welcome and to ask if we need anything. \n\nThere was this guy at the entrance  ( a black guy) im trying hard but canâ€™t remember his name though. He was simply amazing. Very nice person and always assisting with a smile. \n\nThe breakfast was very good! \n\nFree shuttle to Dubai mall , to kite beach and outlet. \n\nMost friendly and helpful staff ever.\nEverything about the hotel was exceptional. We really enjoyed our time there. Will definitely be coming back.\n\nRegards,\nMs Persand from Mauritius",
