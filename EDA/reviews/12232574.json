They offer free parking vale (they take your car and put somewhere else. they say one of the two car parks they had agreement). Breakfast was satisfying. Only I strongly can critisize was the cleaning of the room. It was not clean and I didnt feel confortable when I didnt wear at my feet. The floor covering seemed to have dirt of months. There is complimentary coffee&tea at the room by a kettle. Staff was neat and smiling.",
