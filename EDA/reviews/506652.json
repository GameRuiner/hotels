      "text": "I stayed at The B hotel from the USA last week(April 2024) for 2 nights/3 days.  It was an excellent stay.  The rooms were great the location was even greater.  Marianne at the front desk was excellent and very helpful in assisting with directions and things in the area.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to any and everyone. Located right next to the mall and the subway system.  You cold get anywhere in 5/10 minutes.  1 subway connection and to the airport or the Aerobus lets you out in the square as well; which I took from the airport.  Was a great stay!!",

Very modern, clean, tidy hotel, and the staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. \n\nWe asked for a quiet room and got one, with a very comfortable bed and great facilities in the room. The only negative was a very small shower head that was better suited for pets!\n\nLocation of the hotel was perfect, First stop on the airport autobus and 5  minutes walk to the hotel from the bus stop, metro, and local buses.\n\nWould certainly stay there again next time I'm in Barcelona and would definitely recommend it.",
