Just be aware of this, you might stay here longer than you thought!\nThe location is perfect, easy to get anywhere and anything I need. The room itself is very spacious, clean, lovely and definitely comfortable! Every room has its own bathroom, and the shared kitchen on the roof top is free for use",

In front of our building there were prostitutions who tried to do negotiation with their client!\n\nOnce we kindly asked from the owner to see the other room due to above reasons he started acting very rude shooting speaking in Turkish which my boyfriend can not understand blaming us being rude to him and ruining our first day in Izmir.
