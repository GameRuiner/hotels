      "text": "The best decision I made during my trip to the UAE was to stay at the Waldorf Astoria Dubai international Financial Centre. The facilities and rooms are excellent and the service is very considerate. The only thing I want to point out is that Wen was the best part of our trip. My parents didn't speak English, and Wen took care of them every morning, and she remembered all their preferences. On our check-out day, she even wrote a menu in both Chinese and English for my parents as she wasn’t working in that morning.  She was considerate not only of my parents, who did not speak English, but also of her colleagues, who did not speak Chinese. Five-star hotels do not rely on hotel facilities and hotel design, what can really impress guests is the staff themselves. Thank you Wen for the wonderful memories. Because of you, we will definitely choose Waldorf Astoria Dubai International Financial Center when we come to Dubai.",
