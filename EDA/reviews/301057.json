Quality breakfast and an acceptable outdoor pool add to the hotel's merits. Easy access to shopping centers like Ã¶zdilek avm (though significantly smaller than Istanbul's  Ã¶zdilek avm and not comparable) and istiniye Park, along with numerous restaurants in the area, make it a good choice for staying in the city of Izmir.",

I invited an old high school friend I met by coincidence at the promenade by the hotel to have some beers I had stacked in the mini fridge in my room. Immediately I got a call asking my friend to register at the front desk. When I asked how the knew I had someone else in the room they said they had \"observed\" us on their surveillance system. This would mean that someone followed us from the entrance to the room and then checked how many registered occupants the room has. Really disgraceful behavior for a hotel where privacy should be paramount. ",

I had the pleasure of returning to this place, and I must say, the service was as impressive as ever. Waking up to the stunning sea and land views from my room was a daily pleasure that never lost its charm.\n\nWhat's unique about this hotel is that you get three amazing views â€“ mountains, land, and sea â€“all from your room. This is a rare feature that sets it apart from other hotels.\n\nOne of the standout features of the hotel is its size. It's spacious enough that you don't need to worry about finding a place for breakfast, a sunbed by the pool, or a parking space for your car. There's plenty of everything to go around, making for a relaxed and comfortable stay.\n\nThe breakfast is a real treat. The staff keeps the food coming during breakfast and even into the evening (club), making sure everyone's appetite is satisfied. I would strongly advise taking the club rooms as they provide exclusive access to the 13th floor. Speaking of staff, they all work hard to make sure guests have a great experience. All the staff relations is impressive â€“ they're caring, knowledgeable, and genuinely dedicated to making guests feel welcome. I found out that the hotel invests in training its staff regularly, which explains their professionalism and top-notch service.\nIn the midst of our busy lives, Izmir Ozdilek Wyndham provides a peaceful escape. It's more than just a hotel â€“ it's a place to unwind. My return visit only confirmed that this hotel excels in providing luxury, comfort, and excellent service.\nIn a nutshell, Izmir Ozdilek Wyndham isn't just a hotel â€“ it's a place where each moment becomes a special memory:)\n\n",
