The room was lovely and clean and the bed and pillows are ridiculously comfortable. Walkable to the beach and surrounding areas and about 20-30 min drive to Dubai mall, Burj Khalifa etc. Pool is amazing and we always got sunbeds with towels provided. Gym has everything you may want or need and the bar snacks and pool drinks are very reasonable. They had offers on which meant you could have unlimited pool drinks for a set price. \nStaff can’t do enough to help you and would highly recommend this hotel!",

However, Kavita and Jenny worked their magic and after about 10 minutes they had arranged a room for me. \nThe room was on the 12th floor and had a lovely view of the Marina. \nNice spacious well appointed room. \nHousekeeping wad always on point. I think the person responsible for this was Shakula, apologies if the name is incorrect.\nBreakfast was a very good spread indeed and speedy service.\nThe rooftop bar wad busy but still the service was very top notch.\nOverall a great hotel in a very desirable location.\nWill deffo stay here again if I visit Dubai in the future.",
