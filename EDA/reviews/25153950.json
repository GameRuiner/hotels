      "text": "Arriving at the Address Grand Greek reminds me of arriving home, I really love how the \"Address Hotels\" have this fabulous smell when you walk in. We arrived late and were promptly checked in and taken to the room which had all the amenities you would expect at a 5 Star hotel. I love all the little branded packages just in case you have forgotten to pack a toothbrush it is there. I love the water, coffee and little biscuits. \n\nBreakfast had beautiful baked goods, sweet treats and wholesome cooked food all nice and warm serviced with light fluffy coffees and a selection of high end teas. \n\nI loved the pool, the view was great with nice background vibes, comfortable seats and lots of fresh water. Service from the bar was attentive and friendly with a great restaurant situated next door, where we enjoyed a scrumptious lunch. \n\nMy husband left his ipad upon check out they promptly emailed and went through security to make sure they were giving it back to the correct person. Very thankful for this. \n\nWe were very lucky to get to enjoy the most beautiful club lounge which had a great selection of hot and cold food with fabulous mini deserts and the view of downtown dubai was absolutely breathtaking. \n\nI would highly recommend the Address Grand Creek Dubai as the service from  Anastasia Kadatsenka and the team was exceptional. Thank you for looking after us and setting the standards for a super holiday. Hope to see you again really soon!",
