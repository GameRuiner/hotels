      "text": "Rhodes Bay Hotel is not a five star. I travelled with my husband,  12 year old daughter and her friend. We booked one of the bungalows. It was like something youâ€™d expect from Pontins. We paid Â£400 to upgrade to a duplex room with an upstairs. We arrived at 1am on the morning no food or drink available and when we complained to reception about our room they advised to come back tomorrow, basically pass the complaint to the day staff. \nThe pools are lovely but considering itâ€™s April and thereâ€™s 2 serving behind the bar, expect to wait around 10 minutes even with no queue. Also my daughter waited in the queue and got completely ignored by the rude woman with an attitude. They are too busy asking for room numbers and making you sign for the receipt even though youâ€™re all inclusive.\nThe food is basic and if you want to go to the Italian you have to pay. \nWouldnâ€™t come back here.",

      "text": "Very disappointing holiday after having had high hopes of great service and a luxurious relaxing stay. I travelled solo to this hotel following the death of my Mum. I needed a holiday, a good one where I could really relax and enjoy great service given what Iâ€™d paid for this 5* hotel. \n\nVery sorry to say that on arrival I realised very quickly that this hotel is not about â€˜soloâ€™ travellers! Was give the most awful room, with the view in the first photo. Iâ€™d booked a sea view luxury room and this certainly wasnâ€™t it! Shoved in a small room on the first floor and hidden out of any view. Not good enough. I was grieving and I had to stand my ground and refuse to accept this room, this is not what I had paid for.  \n\nI went to reception immediately and was told there were no other rooms available. This was a lie. There were, because after becoming increasingly upset and actually being in tears, suddenly there was a room! The type of room I had actually booked! Albeit the room was on the ninth floor, meaning every chair movement in the restaurants above sounded like complete furniture removal every day and night! \n\nI didnâ€™t complain as I had my sea view which was beautiful. I spent a lot of time on my balcony enjoying that view. Mainly because I wasnâ€™t made to feel welcome in the hotel. I was on my own and did not feel catered for in any way. \n\nI found the beach to be a better place for me to enjoy the area although I felt uncomfortable most of the time. I am a larger lady and got many looks from other guests which was very unpleasant, and made me feel I shouldnâ€™t be there!\n\nI later discovered that the room I had actually booked was one situated above the fourth floor, I should never have been given the first room on the first floor! I arrived late at night, it was dark, and I believe the receptionist thought Iâ€™d not notice the appalling view I initially had. Disgraceful!\n\nAnyway, the time I spent outside the hotel or on my balcony was great. The view was beautiful and what food I did eat in the hotel was okay. Certainly not what I would have expected from a five star hotel though.\n\nI also found many, but not all, of the guests were what I would consider to be â€˜snobsâ€™ who looked down their noses and frowned at me being on my own! So incredibly rude and they ought to be ashamed. \n\nI spent a fortune on this holiday. I had promised myself a lovely relaxing break after my mumâ€™s prolonged illness and death. What I got was a rip off and a holiday where I was made to feel second best. Such a shame. \n\nI wonâ€™t ever be back, nor would I recommend this place to others, particularly those travelling solo.",
