There was no coordination between the reception team and the Novotel teams, information was lost, and no help was provided. The restaurant did not offer Iftar, but I found an amazing person named MARTA who helped me have a very stable Ramadan Iftar for about ten days. Her involvement, professionalism, seriousness, and respect for religion encouraged me to continue my stay without any problems.",
