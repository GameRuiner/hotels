  "description": "Ohla Eixample is a hotel featuring contemporary design, fabulous cuisine and a one-of-a-kind outdoor pool in Barcelona with a cosy chill-out space located on the hotel rooftop. Located in the heart of the Eixample district, between the exclusive Avinguda Diagonal and the famous Passeig de Gràcia, this hotel is known for its minimalist concept, modern setting and personalised service. Designed by architect Daniel Isern, the façade of this building is one of its highlights, featuring ceramic-based materials. It is also an ambitious and unique project, due to the robotics technique that used the music of Max Richter to create ceramic pieces that undoubtedly contribute to the extraordinary end product. The result is a boutique hotel with 94 rooms, all modern and bright, equipped with all sorts of creature comforts: 40-inch and 55-inch television, satellite channels, free high-speed Wi-Fi, dimmable lights, designer amenities, rain shower and 24 hour room service, among others. Ohla Eixample uses 21st century technology with different finishes and enamelling whose shape hides a line of lights that illuminate the façade at night with a finish reminiscent of paper. A magnificent combination of splendour and harmony that makes Ohla Eixample a meeting point for an unforgettable stay. The menu at Xerta Restaurant (1 Michelin start from November 16) is perfect for anyone looking to discover the culinary secrets of the Ebro region. Chef Fran López is in charge of the kitchen, representing the best version of this cuisine with products from the sea and the land perfectly selected to bring the truest flavours of the Delta to the city of Barcelona",
