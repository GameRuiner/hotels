       "['This hotel is great if you want a good nights kip! Comfortable bed, fridge, kettle, good sized tv and the bathroom is very modern. There is also a safe in the LONG wardrobes which was great! The decor in rooms was just a bit dull (dark wood/carpets/curtains) however im more for comfort, new, fresh and clean, and it was all of these things! Staff were extremely helpful and rooms were cleaned on request.  Turkiye',\n",
       " 'We loved our stay at Eden Roc - we were in one of the bungalows. It was clean and in a nice quiet location. \\n\\nWe stayed for a week which was probably long enough as we were able to do different activities each day. \\n\\nRestaurants were great, but make sure you book as soon as you arrive otherwise it can be hard to get in as they are (other than the buffet restaurant) quite small. \\n\\nThe buffet restaurant had a great selection for breakfast and dinner and it was good quality too. \\n\\nBar staff were great, really friendly and we had a great selection of drinks including premium spirits. \\n\\nHaving a voucher for the restaurant up in the town was ideal and a highlight for us. \\n\\nWe hired a car to go to Lindos and took a taxi to Rhodes Old Town - both worth a visit. \\n\\nA couple of slight negatives (but certainly didnâ€™t spoil it for us) - ants on one night in our bungalow and the pools were salt water and freezing. That didnâ€™t spoil it for our kids, Iâ€™m just getting soft. The ants were dealt with too. Both of those were minor things and wouldnâ€™t stop us returning in future. Dodecanese',\n",
       " 'Hotel was great but the best thing about the hotel was the staff!! Honestly never stayed at a hotel where the staff were so attentive and genuinely nice. Everyday I was at reception asking for recommendations for places to eat and things to do. They bent of backwards to help us, made some amazing recommendations and made all the phone calls always with a smile!!! I will definitely stay here again because of the lovely staff, highly recommend! Spain',\n",
       " 'Spent an amazing three nights here for my birthday and wish it had been longer ðŸ˜Š\\nBeautiful well presented hotel. Lovely spacious rooms. The staff are amazing and very friendly especially Simo, who could not do enough for us. Even hauling our suitcases to Main Street to get us a taxi when the one we booked did not turn up.\\nHotel is in a lovely quiet area but very central to everything. \\nThe rooftop pool and bar are a lovely addition .\\nDefinitely deserves the great reviews and will be back ðŸ˜Š Spain',\n",
       " 'Itâ€™s been 10 years since we visited this hotel and we werenâ€™t disappointed. The hotel has had some excellent improvements made including the Waterpark and restaurants including the Bussola beach bar which was a new addition since our last visit.\\nThe grounds are still beautifully maintained and the staff are still extremely friendly and professional.\\nA special shout out to Damaciano Fernandes who was exceptionally friendly helping with sun beds everyday - what a fantastic guy he is. \\nAlso Amiya who looked after our rooms everyday - he did a great job and always had a smile on his face. Thank you Amiya.\\nWe will definitely be back. United Arab Emirates']"
