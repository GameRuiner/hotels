The food is varied and delicious, the entire resort is SPOTLESS and the pools are beyond compare. As a family, we usually never visit the same place twice, but I feel that this may change now. The trips offered by morning star have been incredible - the best snorkeling that we have ever experienced. The people here are amazing, including manager Mohamed Hassan, who we met today. Every member of staff would bend over backwards to help you, from concierge, to reception, the waiters, lifeguards and the cleaners. I would also recommend a trip to the spa!",

      "text": "I must say our first impressions were not great but they most certainly improved. Initially due to some sort of mix up with the third party we booked with the hotel didn't have our reservation. They still gave us a room but we feel due to this we were given a room that didn't quite look like they did in the pictures. Very tired and rough in places. Adequate but not ideal. Also the first impression of the food wasn't great either but again that improved later  in the trip. There is a lack of information given to you upon check in and you are asked to download an app to get the information which was not very helpful at all. Luckily we spoke to an English couple early in our trip and they gave us all the information we needed and things improved after that. The resort is huge and very impressive. It's tired and run down and a little disjointed in places but they are putting a lot of effort in to it. The majority of the staff are amazing and couldn't do more for you. The beach is beautiful and very big. There are plenty of pools around the resort in which we much preferred the quieter ones at the top tier of the resort. A special mention to the lifeguard/towel guy Mohammed Hamdy, couldn't do enough for us and what a friendly guy. Also Ahmed who works at the pool bar there, he was great too. The two main all inclusive restaurants are fine but we much preferred the cascade one which is new and will eventually become for premier guests only but for now it's for everyone. Again we weren't informed of this and maybe that was a good thing as it meant it was a lot quieter. The guys in there were great too and a special mention goes to Hammad who worked tirelessly to make sure everything ran smoothly, such a nice chap. Also the cocktail bar outside of cascade was fantastic and the barman Ramzy Abdin made the best cocktails and always gave us top class treatment. The ala carte restaurants were great in which you get to pick 3 during your stay we especially enjoyed the Egyptian/ middleastern cuisine (forgot the name of the restaurant). Overall just a few improvements are needed in the resort but still I would highly recommend staying there if visiting Hurghada.",
