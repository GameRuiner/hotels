      "text": "- I stayed with my family for two weeks. While we were in the outdoor pool, someone threw a bottle from one of the hotel room which we thought was like a bomb, it hit the ground, broke and one small particle injured my wife’s eye. We informed hotel security immediately , someone from hotel management came after 10min, although I insisted to call either security or police as it’s a serious event, but he said it’s not possible to find that person anyway, we don’t have cameras capturing either balconies or pool due to the privacy. Cleaner told that the same thing happened few days ago also. As a compensation hotel manager offered 3 free nights within a year, once we have done check out, he never answered my calls or messages.\n\n- Unbearable smell in the room: Once we arrived at the hotel, the kids went to their room and after a few minutes they ran away due to the unbearable smell in their room. I called the reception and informed them about the very bad smell, and asked if someone could come and check if maybe there is a rat dead under the bed. Maintenance team came in an hour, confirmed the smell, just put some spray and said tomorrow we will come and change the AC filter, it's due to the bad filter. They never did, we had to put windows open for few days just to get out of the bad smell. \n\n- Cold rooms without heating: Last  week in Dubai it was rainy and cold, we were freezing in the room, called them to help us to adjust the AC to warm up the rooms, they came and said you can only turn off the AC, we do not have any kind of heating availability. In the middle of the night, I had to ask for a few more blankets to cover the kids where they got sick anyway. \n\n- Hot water unavailability : On our first day, we wanted to fill the bath and take a shower, but after 10min, hot water ran out. After talking to the maintenance team,  we were informed that unfortunately their hot water tank capacity is 50l only and it's normal to run out of the hot water in the middle of the shower, we just need to wait 15min every time, after that it will be warmer :) \n\n- Cleaning challenge: We called them on the 5th day of our stay and asked for the cleaning, they did not come and promised to come the next day, where they did not again, after 2 days we tried to conceive them that we really need housekeeping as it was new year and we want our apartment to be clean, they said we can only send someone to change the blankets :) I had to go to reception, complain madly, show them the contract that weekly cleaning is a part of it, only after 3 days ( on the 8th day) we managed to get cleaning. \n\n- Not allowed to watch fireworks: Because my daughter was sick, we had to come back from new year dinner early with the hope to watch fireworks from our hotel. As our room has sea view and firework is not visible from the room,  we decided to go the gym&pool area to watch the burj khalifa fireworks just 10 min before the new year, and securities did not allow us, they said pool and gym closes at 10, we could not watch the fireworks from the hotel :) There were many people fighting the security for their unprofessional approach and complaining they paid so much money just to watch the fireworks at the hotel and now they are not allowed. \n\nNote: I am super easy person and never complain easily but this experience was one of the worst.",
