This smell continued into our room which was on the fourth floor, notably in the bathroom. \n\nThe carpets leading to the rooms appeared dirty, it was not what I expected at all, leaving us feeling very underwhelmed indeed.\n\nThe room stipulated a court yard view but I’d have ad a better view at Manchester Strangeways HMP. \n\nHowever, the room was clean and did offer refreshments that you were charged for, no freebies.\n\nTea and coffee in the room but for some reason, no milk was provided. \n\nWhat was strange, is that we had a double bed but two single quilts covering it. \n\nSadly, will not be returning. It’s only redeeming feature- the location which was good.",

Definitely exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately noise from a club located in the same building or next door kept us awake all night. Our fault for booking in that area! (Perfect for 20s and 30s :-) We spoke to Ricardo at the front desk the next morning, who graciously agreed to  find us a room in another Sonder hotel in the Gracia area of Barcelona.  Again, the room was perfect. All of the staff we came into contact with were professional, extremely accommodating and a pleasure to meet. If we could give 10 stars, we would. Thank you for your outstanding service, Ricardo and Sonder hotels.",

The cocktails were amazing, and the bartender even made me some that were not on the menu, and was very easy to talk too (as I was travelling on my own, this was much appreciated!)\n\nOverall, I could not fault this place at all.
