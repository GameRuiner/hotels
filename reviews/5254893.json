      "text": "As the title suggests, my designer aftershave was stolen, by what must have been a member of staff. This was reported in the lobby, and they didn't do anything about it. If i didn't have anything stolen from my room, or they would have gone the right way about sorting this out for me, it would have been a four out of five. \n\nGirls at the bar were great, with a special mention for Fatima, and the girls at the bar near the lobby, and the lifeguard Sami. The place is in a great location and is picturesque when looking from the top down, with great views. Most of the staff are really good and nothing was ever too hard to deal with. \n\nI think the welcome staff for a bit below par and lets the rest of the hotel down a little bit, as they weren't really that welcome on our arrival.\nAs it was the end of the holiday season after a couple of days our buffets became limited to about half the amount of food which was fine, because that would cut wastage and there wasn't a massive amount of holiday makers at the time we went.\n\nThe hotel looked bit tired and some parts but it was mostly really nice. The Romans were nice by borderline tacky with everything gold and a lot of the gold paint being marked off due to age and not being refurbished.\n\nAs I said previously, the theft from my room, was really unfortunate that someone in a five-star hotel would do such a thing, and on top of that nothing was done about it, so regardless of a lot of the workers hard work to make people have a special holiday when they're spending time there, this has been ruined by greedy people who had access to people's personal belongings thinking they should be able to take something like for themselves, and also for the staff not to do anything about it was in my view, disgusting. Anyone wanting to stay here I would advise you to put stuff in a safe of any value just to be sure, even though this may have been a one-off I was strongly advise it",

Our room was lovely and the hotel’s location is also lovely. \nWe also read the reviews which the hotel had received.\nWe were very disappointed however that only two of the six a la carte restaurants were open in the evening (Lotus and Thetis) and five days into our holiday the poolside restaurant closed and didn’t reopen (an apparent “technical issue”). There’s was also only one bar available for a pre dinner drink….. \nIt’s was a fight (an argument on the WhatsApp group chat) to book an a La carte restaurant as there was less availability of tables. We understood from staff that the hotel was now in “closed season”……..??? and the hotel was closing…..\nWhilst we were disappointed the choice of food venue was much more limited, we’re angry that neither the hotel or our tour operator #Jet2 didn’t advise this when we booked. Had we known, we would have simply booked a different hotel…….\nSome mornings we woke wondering which part of the hotel food and beverage service would close……on some days the hotel also ran out of Efes, gin, nuts & crisps, Diet Coke and Coke Zero……….(how can you run out of the national beer and coke 😳)\nThis isn’t the 5star resort advertised…..",

When its half closed down and in the process of closing completely!!\n\nWe chose this hotel because of the great reviews it received, the range of facilities and excellent selection of A La Carte restaurants. What an utter disappointment that all was.\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel we were informed 3 of the 6 restaurants were closed and the 3 actually still operating were only doing so on a rota basis thus severely limiting the restaurant selection and availability.\n\nSubsequently we found out that the hotel was in the process of closing for the winter season and many other facilities such as bars, snack bars, evening entertainment and parts of the hotel were already closed and staff laid off.\n\nHad we been made aware that this hotel was in the process of shutting down and only operating at 50% we would never booked to go.\nThe fact this is not made clear is a best a dubious practice.\n\nThe abcence of staff impacted upon the general levels of service - an example being served cocktails in paper Starbucks cups at the pool bar as there were no staff to collect the used glasses from around the pool area.\n\nThis hotel advertises itself as a 5 Star premium resort and as such that level of service should be available to EVERY guest ALL the time.\n  \nAt the time of our stay this hotel is not 5 star and would barely qualify as 3 Star.\n\n",
