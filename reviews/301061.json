However, it hasn’t made any changes so far. \nEverything in the room is so old, apparently they let people SMOKE in the rooms so for those who doesn’t smoke, it’s seriously annoying as the smoke is deep in the old carpets, curtains and the AC. \nThe bathroom makes you feel dirty when you go in to cleanse your self. \nThe walls and bed sheets have moulds.\nIm sorry for the company to write all these here. However, I do not think its fair to stay in such room just because its cheap. \nPhotos are attached!\n",
