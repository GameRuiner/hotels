No stress and food waste with a buffet.\nThe only negatic point was the club with loud music near the hotel, which played until the early hours of the morning. you couldn't hear anything when the window was closed.",

      "text": "This hotel is a small oasis boasting the closest proximity to the sea I've encountered in Dubai. The rooms are  spacious, offering spectacular views. Everything feels new and functions seamlessly. The modern decor exhibits a designer's touch, and the common areas are cozy. The bar and restaurant are exceptional, especially the outdoor section. Although the gym is well-equipped, I would appreciate more upper body training equipment. However, all these amenities would be meaningless without the exceptionally professional, friendly, and well-trained staff who make you feel valued. In my numerous professional trips to Dubai, I've experimented with different hotels, yet in recent times, I've ceased my search and consistently booked with Hyatt Centric.\n\nDuring my last stay, I inadvertently left three credit cards in the room. The hotel promptly notified me and efficiently arranged for the return of the cards, handling the situation with utmost professionalism, having regard to  the fact that this was a sensitive financial issue.\n\nI will certainly book this hotel again and again.",
