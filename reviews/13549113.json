The hotel's strategic location, easily accessible from the airport and overlooking the captivating Al Seef old city, is a standout feature. Over my nearly three years of visits, the consistently pleasant experiences have made this my preferred choice.\n\nA special shoutout to Julius, Muni, Fatima, and Grita for their continuous kindness and support, contributing significantly to the overall comfort of my stays. Their exceptional service has consistently exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, well-maintained, and equipped with a fantastic air conditioning system. The impressive showers add an extra touch of luxury to the experience. Additionally, I'd like to express my gratitude to the diligent housekeeping staff, especially the young lady whose name escapes me at the moment, for her meticulous attention to cleaning details.\n\nIn summary, my stays at Hilton Hampton Al Seef have been consistently satisfying, thanks to the dedicated staff and excellent amenities. I look forward to returning soon for another delightful experience.\n\nKarim",

We had to get bottled water from the check-in counter at the lobby and call service for bathrobes, towels, toiletries, and slippers. The service staff seemed annoyed when we asked for things and said it was not usual for them to deliver these things. There was no in-room dining service either, so we had to get food from the restaurants below and take them to our room. The free breakfast had an average food selection and a long line for coffee.\n\nThe room was clean and the bed was comfy. The hotel design was a mix of playful and boutique styles. The hotel was on a main road but the room was quiet and noise-free.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting experience, but not as good as some Hilton properties in the area.",
