      "text": "Overall, it was an okay experience, but there were several issues that bothered us. Firstly, there was no butter available at breakfast, and the breakfast options remained the same every day despite a variety of items being advertised. While most of the staff were friendly, some attempted to overcharge us for certain services. For instance, when we requested a hookah at noon on the beach, we were informed that the hookah service started at 1 PM, but it arrived significantly later, around 3 PM. Additionally, despite expecting to be free from sales pitches for massages and trips, we found that the hotel staff continued to bother us, often charging exorbitant prices. Furthermore, we booked a king deluxe room, only to later discover that standard rooms had larger bathrooms and balconies, which was frustrating. We were relieved we hadn't opted for an all-inclusive package, as the quality of alcohol and cocktails was poor, and the outdoor California king beds lacked cushioning. Despite claims of the pool being heated, it was not, which was disappointing given the cooler weather during our stay. Arranging airport pickup was excessively difficult, as communication barriers led to us emailing the wrong address and ultimately being left stranded. Additionally, our bathroom was not adequately clean, with noticeable issues such as a brown showerhead and corners stained with old silicone. While the cleaning service was courteous and left decorative towel sculptures, the lack of an adults-only pool was a major drawback for those seeking a peaceful retreat, as all three pools were open to everyone. We also booked the romantic dinner for 5PM. They afterwards told us that they can’t do 5PM and rescheduled to 6PM. When we got there, we were informed that dinner won’t be served right away due to Ramadan. We respect that but we could have came an hour later. Also due to the weather condition the dinner outside was not possible and we had to stay inside the restaurant. Also our room had to hair dryer. We have not ever seen that before. We also did not get the regular small things like soap, Q-tips, sewing kit etc….Definitely not satisfied with our stay",

The food is nothing special, but not bad. The bartenders were not very friendly, they brought drinks until you left the tips, otherwise they didn't come. And the worst experience we had the last day, when we had to leave. we had a bus from the hotel to the airport at 5 in the evening, we had time until 12pm to move out of the room, we moved out in the morning, put our bags down and wanted to go for breakfast, but we were told that our wristbands would be cut off, we couldn't go to lunch, we couldn't have drinks unless we wanted to pay for it. Also they turned off the internet. we had to just sit and do nothing for five hours. Ir was the first time ever that the wristsbans were cut off before leaving. We paid a lot of money and it was awful.  it ruined the good emotions of the whole vacation, I will definitely not go back.",

The hotel staff seem unconcerned about this issue. \n\nYou need to bring lots of $1 bills for tips ($200 worth) - no tips means no service and you'll be ignored or treated rudely. \n\nSome of the male staff act inappropriately, ogling young women and making crude comments about wanting to sleep with guests for better service. The staff seem moody and unwilling to work.\n\nDespite the hotel claiming to have 9 bars and restaurants, only one beach bar is open, with limited drinks and no snacks or ice cream. The burgers and fries served at lunch are greasy and tasteless. \n\nAll 3 ala carte restaurants, only one is included in the all-inclusive package. The others are very expensive with mediocre food, so not worth it. \n\nThe main buffet has massive queues and limited space. The food is extremely bland and undercooked - the chefs seem unskilled. Food choices are very minimal.\n\nIf it’s wasn’t for some of the excursions, we would have been really board after three days. \n\nIn essence we will not be returning to this hotel or be recommending to anyone.
