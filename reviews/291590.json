Reception staff 100% spot on, helpful and friendly. Same with breakfast staff and cleanliness, brilliant!\n\nBar staff a bit cold, but not enough to write anything negative.\n\nOverall very good and served as the base for a good trip",

      "text": "4 nights away with my son at the occidental. Lovely hotel, staff are really welcoming, friendly and helpful. We had the room only option. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The cleaniess of our room was of a high standard and cleaned everyday if you left the sign on the door handle. Breakfast was available if you chose to dine there.\nWe had a sea view which was nice. Transport links are a short walk away, a large shopping centre about a 7 minute walk. Supermarket and restaurant a  couple of minutes walk. We dined at the tango grill (next to the hotel) and you had the option to take away. plenty to see and do in barcelona just make sure you have comfortably footwear as there's alot of ground to cover!\nFor 21 euros you can get the t-usual ticket this lasts for 30 days and you can use it on the airport train, metro and buses within the city zones.  Nou camp ground is under construction (which we didn't realise) so only museum tour available. All in all we had a wonderful time and we would choose this hotel again if we visit barcelona again.",
