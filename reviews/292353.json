The food was again excellent, although not quite as sumptuous as during our stay in 2022, but this only concerned the quantity, not the choice of food. We enjoyed being looked after by Marietta at breakfast and dinner. Here you can feel hospitality in action. We made extensive use of the yoga program. It was conducted by the external service provider Shanti Now for hotel guests free of charge. Due to the season, there were more than enough sunbeds at the pool (very cold) and at the sea (much warmer). We will visit the hotel again.\n\n",
