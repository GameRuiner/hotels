      "text": "The best hotel I ve stayed in Egypt. Room was perfectly cleaned. Food in the restaurant is perfect, everyday i found something, a la carte the same - perfect. Barmans especially on beach bar are very kind and help you with everything you need and they will even entretain you more then animation. Animation looks not interested in anything , they cross you many times without even hello, what doesnt happen with other staff like housekeeping, barmans, waitresses. There is no atmosphere for evening programs to support and clap for the evening shows - people which they come to make show. But if they call for activities its fine that they dont push you to go with them. The area of hotel its nice with many palms, flowers and big pools. Beach is clean and the sea amazing. Special thanks to best barman Mina from beach bar and Ahmed assistant of bar manager.",

      "text": "We arrived at the hotel to receive an upgrade from a dune family room to a dune swim up room. I had found it difficult to choose the room when booking as I didn’t feel there was enough information to differentiate the different room types.\nI love to swim laps so I was really happy with the upgrade.The pools are various sizes, ours was about 30m. It was shared with several other rooms but it was always quiet.\nThe rooms were great with a separate room and bathroom for the children (17 and 15). There was direct access to the pool so this would have been worrying with young children. There were only 2 sunbeds by our pool for 4 of us, but this wasn’t too big of an issue. Seemed strange there weren’t 4.\nThe pool wasn’t heated but perfect temperature for laps and the kids were ok with it.\nThe beds were really comfortable . The shower didn’t have great pressure but it was acceptable. Free toiletries were provided.\nWe loved the hotel, it’s quite spread out so it’s great that they have a cart service, but we didn’t make use of this, except when we wanted to leave with our luggage. So make sure when you ring reception to say how many of you will be taking the cart and the number of cases. We had one person on the cart with the luggage and the rest of us had to walk! Not great in jeans in the middle of the day heat. This was our only complaint.\nMohammed, our housekeeper was brilliant. He came and introduced himself to us on our first day. He came everyday and kept everything clean and tidy, and was really helpful to us. He even offered some books to my daughter to read.\nThe hotel didn’t have many English people staying, there were a lot of Eastern Europeans, Russians and Germans.\nThe entertainment team were friendly but compared to other AI resorts they weren’t as inclusive with the kids.\nThe evening entertainment was ok, lots of choice but it’s quite spread out, across the resort. After the evening show, lots of people disappeared, and it felt really quiet. No idea where people went!\nWe enjoyed the food. Lots of choice in the buffet at breakfast and dinner. There are a good choice of a la carte restaurants. We went to the French, seafood and Turkish. The waiter in the seafood restaurant, Yousef Mohammed (Salah) was really friendly and gave the best service. He also served at lunchtime in the snack bar which has a small buffet section, salads and you could order fresh burgers, chicken etc.  It was very good.\nThere are so many pools and sunbeds, there was never an issue finding somewhere to sit. Most days we sat at the beach. The snorkelling was fabulous so many colourful fish. We walked round to Fort Arabesque beach and enjoyed snorkelling on the reef there. We saw 2 octopus and rays.\nAll the staff were helpful, friendly and polite. It was our first time in Egypt and we would definitely return.",
