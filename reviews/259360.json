      "text": "Top notch hotel. Beautiful rooms; exceptionally comfortable beds and pillows; shower design so nice I took pictures to try to replicate; great roof top bar; beautiful and comfortable lounge. There is nothing I didn't absolutely LOVE about this hotel. Need to check out late? No problem. Need to stow luggage. Of course! And without hassle found in many (every other?) hotels. The staff made everything easy and relaxed and I cannot wait to go back to Barcelona just to stay at this hotel. Genuinely, I cannot say enough good things about the Hotel Duquesa de Cardona Barcelona. \n\nOne note: the location in Gothic Quarter is ideal until about 2:30 in the morning. At that time, the mischief in the streets below gets busy and we were awoken more than once to frightful, blood curdling screams of women in the gothic quarter's streets. This is no slight on the hotel but rather a word of caution for those staying in the area and for those who might be light sleepers.",

They were friendly, helpful and went above and beyond in their services.  The hotel is located opposite to Port Valle and central to Las Ramblas, restaurants, shops and great sceneries.  The hotel's location is ideal!  I highly recommend staying at this property.",

      "text": "This hotel was absolutely wonderful - in a perfect location, had the balance between old world charm and modern conveniences and the staff was incredible. From the time I walked in the door and was greeted by the most hospitable Enrique until the time I regretfully had to check out, I was made to feel like a treasured guest in someone’s home.   In fact, my coworkers and I were all so impressed with Enrique that he is a key reason why we want to make sure this hotel is on our list of hotel options for MWC again next year. \n\nThe hotel is along the street that faces the ocean at the edge of the Gothic quarter and only a block or two from the Born. So it’s in easy walking distance to many sites and a host of restaurants and things to do.  Could not be in a better location.  \n\nThe room was well appointed and large for a European hotel with a nice bathroom. While there was not a coffee machine, there was an electric kettle with tea and instant coffee. Also, there was a small refrigerator with a few drinks available via a mini bar. \n\nThe only thing I’d suggest is to pay the slight up charge to get on the street side of the property.  The back side fronts a narrow street/alleyway and there are some small bars or restaurants that stay open very late and can be quite noisy.  Other than that, my stay was perfect and I highly recommend this hotel.",
