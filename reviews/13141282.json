      "text": "Bulgari Dubai fulfilled every expectation.  From the moment I was picked up from the airport by their car service (prompt and friendly), to the room with the beautiful beach views, clean, beautifully furnished.  The room food service delicious, the vibe of the hotel lively.  A shout out to the hair dresser there as well, just so good.  The level of service and personal care was beyond any expectaion.  Caring, personable, friendly, and genuine.  Mr. Murillo took every extra effort to make sure all my needs were met.  He sent me a very generous Bulgari chocolates box just because!  Truly a memorable stay on every level.  They are paying attention to a level of service that is exceptional. Their beach area is cozy, beautifully appointed, and just gorgeous.",
