      "text": "I was in Barcelona for workacation. Working  remotely and traveling alone. I stayed in the hostel for more than one week. I was kind of new into travailing alone so I booked a room for only women. I kind of liked it. It was a room with six beds all of the women were very friendly and kind. I also make a lot of friends. The room was on the corner, very bright and noisy, sometimes we could hear some luggage rolling on the streets. During the week you also can hear the kinds from the school. This was fine for me, because I get up very early. The reception was very helpful 24h and very friendly. I talk a lot with all the working people. They also have toweled, if you need one for a little amount. The sheets in the room was clean, the room was clean. You have your own locker. I really enjoyed the sweet breakfast and the coffee in the morning. The area was nice close to the estation nord so if you need to get a train also nice. ",

Subway is 5 mins away by walk and you can reach any point you want from hostel. There are lot of markets around it so its not hard to find something to eat or bring with. So, you may make a choice to stay in this place without any doubt!",

The showers were clean but tiny so you need to make sure you don't take anything you want to keep dry into the cubicle. The common area is comfortable and if you want to bring food and cook your own meal there is a cooker and microwave. The Breakfast was OK.   There are shops nearby to get food and the Metro is close enough if you want to get anywhere. Overall I would say it was adequate.",
