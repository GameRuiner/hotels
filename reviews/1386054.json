The staff were very helpful, check in was super easy, the hotel is located within perfect reach to the main area of Pefkos and the beach (which we frequented often). Breakfast, which was included, was great and we were able to get a table each morning. The rooms were clean, comfy and very spacious. \nWe have recommended Island Blue to all of our family and friends, and we are planning to return next year :)",

We loved Kostas at the island blue bar & Nikos & Michaela at swim up bar. We went to swim up bar most days cos of these 2. We didn’t eat in Greek or Italian restaurant but had snacks during the day which were lovely especially the pizza. Hotel is in a great location.",

Stayed in Lindia Thalassa last year which was also lovely. the care & attention given by all staff across the board is exceptional. The grounds are so well manicured, alot of care & attention paid. We stayed B&B, plenty of choice for all tastes. The room was really spacious with a huge terrace. It was my birthday while we stayed & I received a lovely cake & wine which was very thoughtful, thank you. We love it here & have already booked for next year!",

The room was lovely it over looked the pool/pool bar area. The room was large with a large bed. Lovely and spacious. Bathroom was equally as nice as the room all modern. The room has a lovely balcony with space to hang out clothes to dry. The pools at island blue were spacious and clean with plenty of sunbeds with umbrellas. The pool bar was such a nice touch the food was actually incredible such a treat to have and plenty of drinks with lovely staff Kostas. \nI used the spa for a massage which I would highly recommend and rate and got my hair done also that was a lovely experience but I guess my only complaint would be that the staff all know English but choose to speak in Greek when you are having treatments which I just found a slightly inconsiderate other than that my hair was revived for my travels home. \nThe breakfast each morning was standard and does not change, there is something for everyone for sure. \nIf we are ever to return to Rhodes, Pefkos I would be certain to return to this hotel it was stunning and over all just perfect for what you need a holiday!",
