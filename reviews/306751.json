They were so helpful and the check-in and check-out process was very smooth.\n\nMy personal highlight: we had breakfast in the mornings and one of the waiters, Kavindu, served my wife and myself with so much care. He always had our orders in mind, remembered what we like, and was always making coffee for us perfectly! He would start conversation and make us feel welcomed each day, starting out our day feeling blessed by his hospitality.\n\nTo the J5 Rimal staff, thank you.\nTo Kavindu especially, thank YOU! I hope you read this one day!",
