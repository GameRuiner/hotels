If check out is at 12 noon, then why are rooms not ready by 3.00 this was unacceptable and we missed 1 hr of our time at our next activity due to this. \nThey don’t give water except two small bottles every day. Please be ready to buy water from supermarkets nearby . \nThe breakfast area is extremely overcrowded through out and  things get over quickly and refilling takes a lot of time. \nThe size of twin beds was extremely small due to which we had to change the room at 11 PM in the night.\nOnly plus point of the hotel was the service staff specially the house keeping who were very quick and always ready to help\nStay in this hotel only if you need to be close to Indian restaurants otherwise, totally avoidable",
