His brilliant command of various languages was also something I noticed as after speaking to us in English, he put a couple to ease answering their questions in French.\n\nI have removed one star for the hotel not having any element of the hot breakfast prepared to order such as scrambled eggs and hot porridge, little things but this did take away from the experience but everything else was gorgeous including the lovely bottle of cava waiting on our arrival.",

Didn't try the breakfast, pool area and gym very nice to have. Thoroughly recommend. Only caveat is that walls are not completely soundproofed, we were kept awake late by next door room having TV on late, as it's mounted on dividing wall. Parking available 22 euros a day which is fair but cheaper available e.g. H clinic provenca Interparking, download their app for rates down to 12 euros per day.",
