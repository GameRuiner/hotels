      "text": "I strongly advise against staying at this hotel apartment. The staff were unfriendly, and the hot water was lacking; we were instructed to leave the tap running for 15 minutes to obtain hot water. The cleanliness of the room was subpar, with towels emitting an unpleasant odor, and the overall hygiene was poor, with visible dust and stains in various places. The bedding seemed unwashed, contributing to an uncomfortable stay. Despite several staff members present at the reception, there appeared to be a general indifference towards guests, possibly due to low wages or neglect from management. Overall, the hotel's lack of upkeep and attention to guest satisfaction was evident, making it a highly unsatisfactory experience.",

      "text": "Reception staff were not friendly at all. It didn‚Äôt feel like a hotel and we were openly told ‚Äúit‚Äôs a residential building‚Äù when asked why there was no Wi-Fi in the pool area. Checking in took a bit of time with lots of waiting around which was a bit annoying. I had to text and ask for clean towels but in fairness, the towels arrived within minutes of asking for them. No taxi drivers knew the name or location of the hotel so it‚Äôs hard to get back from places and we had to type it into their Google maps. Location is easy walking distance to Dubai mall which was a plus for us. The pool was shut during the storm which was fair but the roads were flooded and there was nothing else we could do that day, so when the sun came out, I asked for the pool to be opened. It was clearly a hassle and one staff even rolled her eyes at me while I was in reception asking about the pool, but they did eventually let us. We were told to wait 30 mins and then a security guy opened up instead of the life guard. After around 20 mins they closed it again as they then said the pool needed cleaning. I just felt a bit like everything was too much hassle which is not how you want to feel on holiday so I would not stay here again.",
