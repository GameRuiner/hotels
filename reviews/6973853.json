Nothing was too much trouble. They gave us so much help, Mark with our trip to Montserrat and the other lady with information about the final stage of the Volta tour of Spain. \nThey are such a joyful enthusiastic  team. A credit to themselves and the hotel.\n\nThe breakfast is a real treat, incredible choice, well presented and cooked.\n\nWe also can’t finish without thanking Ekat Lay, Lory and Corrine who served us our amazing breakfast, Great fun and again ready to organise whatever combination of food my “difficult” husband decided he wanted to try.\n\nWe had never been to Barcelona before, but will go back and absolutely recommend the hotel.\nRoom was really comfortable, we slept well, it was quiet, would recommend a room with a terrace over looking the garden.\nIts position is perfect for La Rambles, Catalonia Square and the Gaudi sites. \nH10 have several hotels in Barcelona, we picked this one for the area it was in and we were really pleased we did.",
