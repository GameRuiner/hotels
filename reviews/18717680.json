      "text": "We had a fantastic time at Andaz for our Honeymoon. We arrived so early and weren't expecting to be checked in( guy on check in was so so good, can't remember his name unfortunately, checked in around 7am and was room 518 on 31st March). We got a room upgrade and my wife received a complimentary massage. The food options each day were top notch - never had so many choices for each meal. The staff were so attentive and were always on hand to assist you or help. The beach was so easily accessible and the swimming pool. The adult pool on the 14th floor was amazing - so quiet with great views and again amazing staff at the bar and to help you with the sunbeds. ðŸ˜€\n\nWe would highly recommend this hotel and hope to be back someday. \n\n",

      "text": "I have been to Dubai a few times and stayed in the JBR area and this was my first time on the Palm. This hotel was really great. It was in an excellent location with the Nakheel shopping mall directly across the road and Club Vista Mare bars and restaurants right next door. There is a lovely sandy beach and if you want it a 5K beach walk from the hotel beach. Taxis were available all day and because of the location not expensive to go anywhere at all in Dubai. The hotel has two pools one large one on the ground floor level, suitable for families and one adult one on the 14th floor. I spent most of my time here and found it great, with comfortable beds a life guard and bar service. The hotel staff overall were excellent, nothing was a hassle. I was checked in as soon as I arrived and got a room upgrade. The housekeeping staff were great and very easily contacted for extra soft drinks and snacks. Reception checked in every so often to make sure everything was going well. I totally recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dubai.",

      "text": "We arrived just after 130pm and our room wasn't yet ready. We had booked on a full board basis so were directed to the locale restaurant for lunch whilst our room was prepared. \nWe were a little disappointed at the very little options for vegetarians. We asked if they had a veggie burger option which they did not. They suggested a Thai green veg curry which was not something we would have but tried it. It wasn't to our taste so was concerned when we realised we had another 4 lunches there! That night my husband asked if they could make a veggie dish but without the egg which they said no. There wasn't a great deal of options in the evening buffet. \nThe next day we headed to la coco and was given a set menu to choose from which again wasn't great for veggies so my husband spoke to the reception team after dinner. They were very accommodating and arranged for the chef to speak with us the next day. The next 3 nights they made us food and even made our son fresh paratha everyday. They were so kind and really made our final few days in dubai great. \nThe rooms are very modern and clean albeit a bit tight with a toddler and 4 cases / pushchair but we made do.  \nThe housekeeping didn't turn up until later on in the evening 5 / 6ish which at that time of night our son was napping so this was a bit annoying however we do appreciate it is more a city hotel so are probably busy turning rooms around ready for new guests. \nThe location is great for the mall and monorail etc.\nThe pool was shared with other apartments / residences and we couldn't get sunloungers at all. \nThe beach was nice but quite windy. \nAll in all I think we were quite happy with our break but the fullboard situation wasn't explained on booking that you have a fixed lunch menu with little option. Although they did help us out after we'd spoke to them we probably wouldn't have booked the hotel if we had known. \nThe locale staff and chefs  were lovely and a real credit to the hotel. La coco wasn't im afraid to say, the staff weren't really friendly and there was no real atmosphere down there.",
