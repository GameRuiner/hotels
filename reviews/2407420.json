Fantastic location, next door to the Metro, aswell as amazing views, our room was 5503, panoramic views all around the room, very spacious, with good taste of decor. Our room was cleaned to a very high standard every day, clean linen aswell,  as fresh white towels. Walk in shower, 2 bathrooms. Restaurant was amazing with fresh salads, lots of meats and puddings that were delicious. Breakfast was also great with plenty of meats and different pastries and breads. We ventured out to the dessert, a must, with camels, dune buggy, to finish off with a lovely meal and live show. Thank you to all the team at the hotel.",
