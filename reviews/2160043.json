Arrived a bit late and had to order from hotel restaurant food came to our room 1.5 hrs later and burnt, dry and cold (around 11.30pm) they forgot to add my drink as well. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Wobbly shower base needs changing for sure.\nOnly reason I want to make a point is breakfast, lady whose prepared breakfast asked me my room number while I had a full plate and I think it is a bit embarrassing should be ask when you enter the restaurant. She also chopped simit by hands and filling bread basket without wearing gloves which is not hygienic and I didn't get any..",
