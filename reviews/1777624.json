      "text": "The venue is truly stunning, a perfect setting for a delightful dinner with my family. The picturesque fountain view added a touch of elegance to the experience, and the staff was indeed warm and welcoming. However, if I were to suggest an improvement, it would undeniably be the speed of service. It was quite disappointing to wait a whole 40 minutes for my pizza and pasta to arrive, especially after the starters came out in a prompt 20 minutes. The prolonged wait for the main course somewhat dampened an otherwise enjoyable evening.",

      "text": "Ramadan Nights by Armani\nMarch 10 – April 08, 2024\nArmani Hotel Dubai\n\nWhat does the Armani Hotel offer for Ramadan?\n\n- Share the spirit of Ramadan in the stunning setting of Armani/Pavilion\n- As the sun sets, break your fast with a curated Iftar experience \n\nIftar at Armani/Pavilion\nSunset until 9pm\nAED 385 per person including Ramadan juices, soft drinks, freshly brewed coffee and tea\n\nIt sounds good. but there is one \"BUT!\" Nowhere does it say that there will be half naked girls too! Why call a dinner \"iftar\" if there is no dress code? I couldn't believe my eyes!\n\nI came with my family, and we were waiting for the adhan, and no one ate until the adhan began, since this is a Muslim country, people fast here, and the hotel wrote that this is a separate place for iftar, it was generally in a separate place with a separate entrance, on super \"backyard\" venue for ballrooms and private events. How did the “naked” girl gallop there and how did they let her through? !!!!\n\nIf you call the event a religious name, then why invite mermaids? I wouldn't have come if the event was called \"dinner for naked people.\" I'm so shocked I can't tell you! let's call everything by their proper names!",

Upon checking in, Gracer Torres was very courteous and hospitable giving out our request to have the best room we could have and at the same time, giving us a wonderful extended service by sending us a complimentary dessert and welcome fruit serving. To name also some friendly and excellent service staff, Sagan, Kaung and Salini provided great service to us. Cant wait to be back soon with my family! :)",
