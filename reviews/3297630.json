      "text": "We had a fantastic stay at JA Ocean View\n\nMy Grandson is Autistic, Sunjoy from the main restaurant is so kind, he upgraded us to the executive suite for breakfast.\n\nThe room is very spacious, huge bed.\n\nFood is excellent, lots of choices.\n\nThe location is perfect, many shops, restaurants, also have McDonaldâ€™s, KFC, Burger King and Pizza Hut right next door all 24 hours.\n\nThe hotel is beautiful, lovely pool area, tennis courts, gym and salon.\n\nThe beach is so beautiful, 2 minute walk away.\n\nTaxi right outside, use the hotel taxi, they are better and match the price of Careem.\n\nYou cannot buy alcohol so bring it with you or go to the marina mall to Waitrose, go down two escalators to the car park and there is a place that sells really cheap alcohol, you will need to take a passport with you.\n\nUse Klook to book all your excursions to save money.\n\nI asked the hotel for extra pillows and 30 hangers and it was promptly provided.\n\nFavourite staff Julie and Sunjoy from the main restaurant, they are so friendly, helpful and kind.\n\nThe location of the hotel is perfect, right near beach and walking distance to the Marina and Marina Mall",

When we arrived, we asked for a disabled access room, and the staff were happy to accommodate us immediately.\n\nThe hotel is located at the JBR walk neighborhood, which in my opinion, is the best place to stay in Dubai. It is right by the beach, and also surrounded by high-quality restaurants and shops, and five minutes drive to Dubai Marina Mall. Most importantly, the service is impeccable.\nSpecial thanks Mr. Hashim and Ms. Merry, Who made us feel like home!\n\nI highly recommend this hotel, and will definitely consider coming back in our future trips.",

It came and went with no gesture from the hotel. I didn't expect anything beforehand, so why say something and no do it.",
