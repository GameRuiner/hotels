The upper level had a private terrace with an outdoor shower, a bedroom, a sink, and a toilet. Downstairs we had a sofa bed, desk, mini bar, coffee maker, and a bathroom with a shower. The room was very quiet and comfortable. \n\nThe location on Gran Via was very good. It was a short walk to Plaça Catalunya, Casa Batlló, Casa Milá, Palau de música, La Rambla, and Barrí Gotíc. It was also very easy to catch a cab to La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. \n\nThe staff at the front desk was very helpful and nice. The two women in the breakfast room were also very pleasant and hard working. There were several choices in the breakfast room including melted chocolate.",

      "text": "The hotel is in a great central location.  We had a lovely room at the front of the building, which was surprising quiet given it is on a main road.  The room was a decent size with a very comfy bed.  Although we weren't able to use it, the outside area is lovely and would be great in the summer.  I have only given this hotel a 4 mainly because we were very disappointed with the breakfast, especially when compared to other Catalonia hotels we have stayed in - the main issue being that the choice was a bit limiting especially when items weren't replenished meaning that if you were there at the wrong time the choice was extremely poor.  Having said that the restaurant staff were lovely.",

We had multiple issues and had to move 2 times to get a room that was working properly and we just got back. I can’t imagine what the summer months would be like. \nHowever and most important the staff is amazing and the owners should be very thankful that their hospitality is stellar. My suggestion to the owners invest in a new cooling system as well as a keyless entry option since the cards are sensitive and it was annoying having to go get a card every time it wasn’t working.",
