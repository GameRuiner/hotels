Would like to give a special mention to the breakfast staff who are so friendly and the receptionist who booked us in, it was only his third day and he was very helpful. Breakfast was as always very tasty and a good selection I would never normally have cake for breakfast but the almond cake with orange was delicious. We stored our bags as we had an evening flight which was a lifesaver and really easy to get a taxi. It is an understated friendly hotel and I would really recommend it highly",

So, easy get from the airport and within walking distance from some of the major sightseeing spots in Barcelona.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful; I was especially surprised on my birthday, when we were offered cocktails at breakfast (after somebody from the staff noticed that we had a couple of glasses of cava). I highly recommend getting the breakfast, as it offers a good variety of food and drinks, it is very convenient option to start the day as a tourist who wants to spend the next 4-5h visiting landmarks.\n\nI didn't get to try out the swimming pool at the 8th floor, due to the weather, but the view was very nice.\n\nBeing located on a relatively busy street, I recommend getting a room with a view towards the back, in case you find traffic noise disturbing.",
