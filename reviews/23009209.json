There's no noisy and harassing that's typical elsewhere. The restaurant has a very good kitchen and offers cool drinks in two bars. The bus will take us to the hotel beach, although we preferred warm pools in seven in the morning. The staff have a good sense of humor and responsiveness, so a separate gratitude to Tamer, Mohammad, Ali, Zakaria, Mohammed, Ahmet, Ali, Shenouda, Ali, Mohammed... Thank You for good relax!",
