      "text": "I suspect that I will stay here again on a return to Barcelona. The hotel has a fabulous position on La Rambla, and is efficiently run, super-friendly, clean and comfortable. Full marks.\n\nI very much liked the free mini bar in the room, and especially the complimentary large bottle of water. The shower was good, there was a good range of bathroom amenities and the towels and robes were of excellent quality. \n\nThe roof terrace was a great place to relax, and drinks were a phone call away.\n\nThings I didn’t like so much included the absence of hair conditioner in the shower; the shampoo-conditioner combination on offer was not that brilliant. Some of the recess lighting under the shower surround in room 502 was coming off. And there was a lack of bedside sockets to plug in devices; there needs to be at least one easily-accessible socket at table height on each side of the bed. I would also avoid the rooms next to the lifts, which make clunking noises whenever they stop at a floor.",
