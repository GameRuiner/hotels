      "text": "Thoroughly disappointed, booked the hotel as a suprise for my husband and two children, finding a hotel with a swimming pool centrally to Barcelona. However on arrival the pool isn't open. I have double checked the website and can't see an obvious notice to say this is the case. Two very disappointed children and a real taint on our stay. Reception apologised and said they would let the website team know but nothing more they could do. \nStaff all very friendly and tried hard to welcome tired children when we arrived from travelling with little activity packs and some sweets. Check in took a while even after \"checking in online\", which I would say was a waste of time, didn't seem to speed up the process. \nLocation perfect, room quite tight for the full family but it's manageable.",

      "text": "Novotel Barcelona City is a budget hotel located just off the Avenue Diagonal in the Sant Marti section of Barcelona, Spain. \n \nThe front desk staff is very pleasant and helpful, just inside the rotating entry door (use the rotating door, it saves energy by keeping the air-conditioned/heated air inside the hotel. Using the doors allows it to escape).\n \nThere are 3 elevators that will be your first challenge. During peak times, it may take a while to get an elevator to your room floor. The elevators are small and require a key to access your floor. In the morning, during peak times - if you are on a lower floor, the elevator will stop and be full repeatedly. I would suggest that when this happens that you press both the UP AND down buttons and get on any elevator with space. This may be your only option to get to the lobby. It can get pretty bad. \n \nThe rooms are basic but have everything you need. I like how they charge a flat rate for any item in the mini bar. The furnishings are dated but function well. \n \nThe bed is my biggest complaint. The sheets are of poor quality with a cotton mix vs. full cotton sheets you find in better hotels. If you sleep 'hot' normally, expect to wake up in a pool of sweat- even though the air conditioning is good year-round! The pillows are terrible too. On a queen/king bed they supply two square useless pillows and two mini pillows. I am not sure what function the square pillows have, and the mini pillows are comfortable enough but why do they have to be so small? \n \nThe bathroom is well lit, and this hotel finally provides pump type toiletry items (shampoo, body wash, hand wash) instead of single use ones. This is a really nice change. TIP - if you do not want sewer smell coming up through your sink drain, close the stopper and keep some water in the basin. It can get bad. \n \nThe rooftop amenities are very nice, especially in the warmer weather. \n \nThis hotel advertises as a 4-star hotel on Google Maps. This is NOT a 4-star hotel by any stretch. I will be rating this hotel with 3-stars, based on their 4-star claim. Had they listed as a 3-star hotel I would have rated them at 4-stars.",

      "text": "This was the worse place you can stay for Barcelona break. the rooms are very very small, between bed and wall there is only space for hand language space. We arrived just before 11 am. We have paid extra for city view. We were told we could get in to the room in the next 30 to 45 minute. However when I asked if we getting what we booked for they humbled and another staff member came and they said the check-in in 2pm and we had to wait. despite rooms available they made us wait until 2pm and dead on 2pm they said room ready we had to wait 3 and half hours at the reception.\nthe rooms are very tiny I would not recommend for anyone more then 2 in the room.\nIts February and the weather is not very warm but we had to open windows as the air condition wasn't working well it was very warm at the room. \n\nits 20 minute to the center by taxi with traffic can be 30 to 35 minute.\nBreakfast is not bad for for 4 star I would say is very poor.\nRoof Top is stink of food cooking smell inside and outside is open top very cold at nights.\n\nThe staff aren't the helpful if you need any help.\n\nWaste the money for this hotel, rather stay at 1 star hotel at the center of Barcelona.",
