      "text": "Avoid at all costs.  We stayed at this hotel in April 2021 and had a decent stay, the place had newly opened and had a decent set of amenities.  Fast forward 6 months when we returned to Dubai we booked this hotel again. \n\nBIG MISTAKE - this hotel well and truly sits in my top 3 worse hotel experiences of my life.  I am not fussy when I stay in hotels and usually only use the rooms to sleep and have a bath/shower.  I am out most of the day, so my main concern is that the room is clean and comfortable. \n\nWe checked in around 6AM due to a 3-4 hour flight delay and even in such a state realised the room did not appear as clean as it should.  Once we had the opportunity to assess the room we raised a formal complaint, which resulted in the hotel sending 2 cleaners and a 'manager' to assess our complaint. \n\nI pointed out everything that was left dirty and showed them cleaning wipes I had used on the table and other room areas to showcase how much dirty, dust and food particles had been left behind. He assured us that we could leave the room and he would ensure the room was thoroughly cleaned. \n\nWe left the room for circa 10 hours and upon our return sadly over half the issues we had pointed out had not been cleaned. Just plain nasty but especially dangerous during covid.  So I have had to resort to cleaning and sanitising the room myself.  I left a note requesting them to review and clean the room properly today but apart from making our bed (which I had made already), they did no cleaning.  Nobody even stepped foot in the bathroom, let alone clean it. \n\nThe room stinks of smoke, so I have had to turn on the air conditioning unit on full and leave the window wide open.  Which results in the constant noise of the busy traffic between Sharjah and Dubai.  \n\nThe windows are stained with bird poop and the curtains are caked in dust and dirt. The carpet is dirty, the wardrobe sliding doors are broken and the list goes on... \n\nFor 2 nights now I have had to have a cold shower as there has been no hot water.  After making a second formal complaint about this today someone came to our room who advised us that we should leave the sink taps on when having a shower to ensure we get a lukewarm shower and that is the best it would do. \n\nThe only pro is that is it very close to where my brother apartment so I have been able to go to his apartment for respite during the day. I am booked here until midday Friday and cannot wait to check out and move to a different hotel.",
