      "text": "I was on a business trip to Izmir and decided to book this hotel due to its location close to the office.\n\nI booked directly (via Accor) and unfortunately, at the time of reservation, it was not possible to pay for the hotel online.\n\nI was arriving late into the night, on the 27th of September 2023, but since I checked that the front-desk was open 24/7, I decided it would be ok to be checked in after midnight.\n\nWhen I arrived to the front-desk around 1 AM, I was told that there is no room, as they cancelled the reservation. The email that I received stated that it was cancelled on my request, which, of course, was not true.\n\nThe front-desk employee couldn't provide any reason, so we had to call the manager of the hotel.\n\nAfter some back and forth with very aggressive and impolite manager, it turned out that he arbitrary decided to cancel the reservation (and I would assume, sell this room for much more money to someone who gave him a good baksheesh).\n\nThroughout my 100+ nights with Accor Hotels, I have never had such an issue - which makes me assume that it was the manager of the hotel who had interest in selling this room to someone else. \n\nThe front-desk employee was helpful looking for another hotel and arranging for a taxi for me, which was indeed a stark contrast with his manager, who was yelling on the phone that everything was not his problem.\n\nA few days later I was able to recover the workflow of the issue:\n\nWhile I was flying, around 9 PM, the hotel tried to authorise the payment (which was a little interesting, as they didn't do it during any of the days between reservation and the arrival date). The bank decided that the hotel was a scam (which typically happens when a company was reported as scam before) and cancelled the transaction. The manager used this as an excuse to cancel my reservation. There is no need to say, that the hotel didn't try to reach out via email or phone, they just cancelled the reservation.\n\nI later read on Google Reviews that this is not an uncommon thing - the manager of this hotel does this kind of things regularly. \n\nI would like to urge whoever is thinking about staying at this hotel, to stay elsewhere.
