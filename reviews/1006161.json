      "text": "We loved our stay at Eden Roc - we were in one of the bungalows. It was clean and in a nice quiet location. \n\nWe stayed for a week which was probably long enough as we were able to do different activities each day. \n\nRestaurants were great, but make sure you book as soon as you arrive otherwise it can be hard to get in as they are (other than the buffet restaurant) quite small. \n\nThe buffet restaurant had a great selection for breakfast and dinner and it was good quality too. \n\nBar staff were great, really friendly and we had a great selection of drinks including premium spirits. \n\nHaving a voucher for the restaurant up in the town was ideal and a highlight for us. \n\nWe hired a car to go to Lindos and took a taxi to Rhodes Old Town - both worth a visit. \n\nA couple of slight negatives (but certainly didn’t spoil it for us) - ants on one night in our bungalow and the pools were salt water and freezing. That didn’t spoil it for our kids, I’m just getting soft. The ants were dealt with too. Both of those were minor things and wouldn’t stop us returning in future.",

      "text": "The beach front location of Eden Roc is fantastic, we loved how easy you could flit from the pool to the beach and vice versa. \nHighly recommend taking sea shoes if you’re going in the sea. The sea is clear, great for snorkelling. \nThe beach front bar and restaurant is gorgeous. As was the buffet and other Al la carte restaurants. \nGood choice of drinks. \nEvening entertainment is good. \nRooms were nice, my parents had an upgraded room to us, same layout just more modern. Although ours was dated it was still nice. We requested a quiet room which we got. \nTheres a couple of restaurants and a bar about 5/10 minute walk outside the hotel. Faliraki isn’t too far in a taxi if you are looking for something livelier. \nVisited Rhodes Town for a day and evening, really wasn’t expecting it to be as big as it was, simply stunning area and definitely worth a visit day or night. \nWould return.",

      "text": "A wonderful celebration holiday for my daughter’s 21st. We travelled as a family of 5. \n The front desk staff were very understanding and kind -they upgraded us to a suite in the main building - where my elderly mum could easily reach all the amenities. The panoramic harbour view from the balcony is a memory we will treasure. \nThe a la carte restaurants bookable within the all inclusive put this hotel into a class of its own. The Peruvian, the Teppanyaki and the Greek were our favourites -can’t wait to rebook them next visit.\nYou get international brands for all inclusive drinks- we visited the wine bar every evening for a glass of fizz, and we  all loved the cocktails. Each a la carte has its own signature cocktail which was a lovely  touch. \nThe entire staff group are a credit to the hotel. We had such a wonderful experience we are rebooking for this year.",
