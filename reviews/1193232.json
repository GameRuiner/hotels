As a native of this region, I go to the thermal baths from time to time, which gies me an opportunity to see the decay of management there. Namely, the pools are fine, the criteria for hygiene are very reasonable, compared to some hotels in the city. However: the visitors who do not follow up the rules and regulations about using these pools are not warned by the people who are in charge of taking care of these pools. It is clear that the management does not want to scare people by enforcing these rules. Wearing a cap should be compulsory for everybody. Other than that it's just fine.",

The pictures are not true to the condition. When I called to report this, I was told the manager would call back, but nothing after that. We ended up having showers strickly in the indoor and outdoor pool showers that were also unpleasant, but at least the water wasn't smelly, just an awful experience.\n\nOn booking I mentioned that my wife and I were newly wed and it's our first trip together and if they could treat us, but nothing was done and the place seems like a place for the ill and elderly. Staff seem miserable.\n\nSome pools not were not in service so the outdoor waterpark was somthing i was looking forward to but that was half a disappointment.\n\nThe breakfast was a large selection of cheese and olives, but the hot food was always cold. I could go on, but we concluded to simply do not recommend.",
