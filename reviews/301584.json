      "text": "I want to give a balanced view of this hotel.Pros - Hotel was extremely clean, food was high quality , brilliant entertainment . Staff overall very friendly and helpful . Grounds immaculate , facilities excellent . A very attractive holiday for any holiday maker wanting a beach holiday close to JBR . Lots to see and do close by .\nCons - it was Easter , sold out , very busy . We were offered an upgrade for  a sea view room to a suite city view but decided not to take it up due to us wanting a sea view . We were there for the beach . Room very small for 3 of us .  . Bathroom felt small with a separate bath and shower . Room was small . Shampoo not working as attached to wall and had to contact reception twice to get it fixed . I miss little bottles of luxury shampoo and shower gel . We had to ask several times for items from staff at breakfast . Again they were rushed off their feet but very apologetic . There is a big following of holiday makers that visit this hotel usually Royal Club people . People who return year on year and know each other, lots that love football   . They’re usually very ‘special celebrity ’ guests who have sun beds reserved for them each morning by pool staff . \nNot sure we’ll be back . But we did have a lovely holiday. Quite lovely hotel and fairly noisy .",

      "text": "I booked this as I had always wanted to stay at LRM as my parents had stayed here back in the 1990’s, but just for some reason I’d just never booked this hotel.\n\nI had ready many reviews before booking and there is rarely a bad one so I was thinking can this hotel really be that good? And in summary, no it’s actually better!\n\nWe arrived around 10.30am and had a Royal Tower Room so were whisked off to the separate check in, and were checked in with our room due to be ready very soon so then taken to get coffee and pastries whilst we waited.  Before 11.30am we were in our room.\n\nFirstly the rooms are gorgeous, given the age of the hotel they renovations to keep it modern have been done so well, and the rooms are immaculate and stylish.  We had a 13th floor JBR view room and it was lovely, and the size of the balcony was a huge bonus!!  Thet who was our cleaner, did an awesome job and was always flexible about what time he came and turned down our room which was appreciated.\n\nAs soon as we unpacked we headed down to the pool. It was good to see plenty of sun loungers and space and a pool team who help find you a sun lounger which is nice.  There are three pools, all of which are lovely, the only thing I found slightly odd was none seemed to be adult only. It wasn’t an issue but most hotels with multiple pools seems to have one adults only, but this didn’t impact anything was more an observation.  The grounds of the hotel are huge and well maintained and offered direct beach access. For me this was why I booked the hotel as I love direct beach access and the space around the hotel was just a bonus.  What I liked was 5e pool staff were happy to bring you ice buckets as most people brought water down from their room (which was free and in plentiful supply ), I’ve visited Dubai hotels were they aren’t keen to give you ice if you haven’t bought anything, yet at LRM there was never any pressure to buy food or drinks around the pool. The little touches like a cold flannel and an ice lolly in the afternoon were also well appreciated.\n\nAs we had the Royal Tower Room we had lounge access and this made the holiday for me.  The staff in the lounge are all fabulous and so welcoming, even remembering drinks orders in the evening!! The afternoon tea and evening canapés nearly meant we didn’t need dinner and two hours of free alcoholic drinks between 6pm and 8pm was fantastic.  The fact the lounge is spacious and has a balcony outdoor area was also lovely.  What was apparent with the lounge was how many people actually did visit the hotel at least once or twice a year and have been coming in many cases for 10+ years, which again shows how good the hotel is.  The lounge staff were greeting return customers by name which shows the level of service.\n\nAll the restaurants in the hotel, and the Grosvenor House which is literally a 10min walk which wasn’t an issue in March as not too warm to walnut, were fantastic and I think  we managed to eat in a good proportion of them and didn’t have a bad meal or poor service at any point.\n\nI can honestly say this might be my new favourite Dubai hotel and I am certainly hoping to become one of the regular visitors!!\n\nThank to everyone at LRM for such a lovely holiday.",
