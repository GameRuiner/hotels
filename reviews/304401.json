I'm pleased to say that I was allocated a room (403) in the quiet part of the hotel and was not disturbed by noise at all.  Colleagues who were affected asked to move and were moved to quieter rooms whenever possible. \n\nThe rooms are big, and although the fittings are a little tired everything was functional and comfortable, with piping hot water at good pressure.  Room service restaurant meals, while not haute cuisine, were perfectly acceptable and prompt. Daily cleaning of the room was good.\n\nService from the hotel staff was exemplary - they were all very helpful and responsive - answering questions, obtaining cabs and providing printing on request. If I were looking for low-cost accommodation in Dubai again, I would be very happy to stay here again.",
