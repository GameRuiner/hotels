The receptionist was very rude, sarcastic...she's a young girl with black hair.    the guy that helped us with our luggage was excellent and helpful and so was the room maids.",

      "text": "My option of choosing this hotel was because it is closed to Basmane Train / Metro station and I had the option to stay in hotel without breakfast included as I had to go out at 7-8 am every morning during my 4 day stay. Besides this hotel has certificate of safe tourism as one of my standard conditions on staying in hotel during global pandemic.\n\nIt was pleasant stay and I had good rest. Happy to be in comfortable NK Hotel especially previously I stayed in terrible hotel in Bergama. Clean, spacious room with good sound proof, tea and coffee making facility, and no shampoo or liquid soap in small bottles but Dove shampoo and soap. Environmentally friendly. Recommended!",
