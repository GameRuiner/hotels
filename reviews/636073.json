      "text": "Ok let me get this straight. There are no 4-5star hotels avalible for charter/travel package in europe as far as i know.\n\n5star is equal a regular 3 star hotel and thats also how i see this hotel/resort.\n\nAll inclusive lunch and dinner was 3/5. Breakfast had a higher standard. Food is ok but will not make you crave for more.\n\nRoom was ok but with a poor barely working AC which is also very common. \n\nLocation for us was ok as we had a rental car. Without it i don't know if i can recomend staying here.\n\nThe waterpark is nice and clean. so is the pool area.\n\nThe lounge area is very nice in the evening and offer a well deserved relaxing enviroment after a full day.\n\nThe beach just close to the hotel (600m) is not so nice, but there are other fantastic beaches worth a visit. Just don't expect to have anything on walking distance",

      "text": "\nWe have just returned from our second wonderful holiday at this hotel.\nWe were greeted at reception when we arrived with a lovely juice drink which was greatly appreciated. We had a superb suite (over the road), which had a lovely view out to sea, perfect for your morning coffee and watching the sunrise, the beds were really comfortable, and great black out curtains.\nThe food was lovely and great variation, it was nice to get snacks at the various pool bars, which kept our 9 year old daughter going. Breakfast was great with a wide variation of choices on offer, to cater to all tastes.\n\nThe quieter pool near the beach was lovely, with the added bonus of the beach front bar, where there were self serviced drinks and amazing baguettes/wraps as well as salad, we generally had lunch there everyday as the view out to sea was amazing and it was very peaceful.\n\nThe water park is so much fun, really good slides, enough for everyone, when we went in October half term there was always more than enough sunbeds and seating when we were up there.\nLater in the afternoon we would go up to the main pool which was good, again plenty of sun beds, followed by a drink in the main bar, wonderful cocktails with beautiful views of the mountains and out to sea.\nAs we were returning guests, we received an invitation to a cocktail and canape event, which was really lovely and very well organised. Our daughter loved being treated as a “VIP” and we were given lovely gifts to bring home – we thought this was a really lovely touch.\nWe would like to say a special thank you to Katerina, who was truly amazing, and went beyond with customer service, also to Stavros and all the bar staff who were truly lovely and committed to giving a great service.\nLastly a big thank you to Kiki who answered all my queries, and made us feel very welcome throughout our holiday.\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to others.\n",

      "text": "We visited Atlantica Mikri Poli at the end of October and we couldn't ask for more.\n\nKiki was really helpful in the run up to our holiday, upgrading us to a room with a seperate bedroom and arranging for birthday drinks and cake for my 12 year old son and wife in our room on their birthdays whilst we were there.\n\nThe room was very modern and clean. The resort was also very clean and tidy - the grounds staff are constantly on the go. The bar/restaurant staff also did not stop and were very friendly. The animation team were amazing. They were full of energy and made the entertainment and the day times games something to really look forward to. The (child friendly) cocktail game and water polo were our favourites.\n\nThere are loads of pools to choose from and we never had trouble getting sunbeds even later in the morning. We mainly pitched by the main pool where the games were played but ventured over to the waterpark a few times each day to ride the slides and float around the lazy river.\n\nThe food was excellent. We ate in the buffet everyday (except one night in the italian restaurant) and the choices were great, even for our vegetarian son. The poolhouse and creperie were great for daytime snacks and lunch. There was a good range of drinks - Ask for rum slushies at the pool bar.\n\nMy wife had a full body massage and facial in the Spa on her birthday and which she said was very relaxing.\n\nMemories cocktail bar in Kolymbia is a good place to watch the football. They had a good range of cocktails, spirits and even ciders.\n\nWe hired quadbikes for one day and rode to Lindos to see the Acropolis and then to Rhodes town to visit the Myth Colossos of Rhodes and the Medieval town - Definitely worth the day out.\n\nOverall we had an incredible week away and would highly recommend staying at Mikri Poli.",

The resort is very beautiful and well looked after, the staff is friendly and helpful and the food is very good and varied. The resort offers plenty of space and places for fun with kids as well as relaxed areas with  a calmer atmosphere. The beach is just across the street, which was really no big deal. Sunshade and loungers are 6€ per day, which I thought was ok, since we weren't at the beach every day. The beach consists of little stones and bigger ones in the water. You don't really need shoes for the water but in case you have them anyways it might be a bit more comfortable. There are plenty of shops just a few minutes walking distance as well as at the hotel itself. Very recommended is the restaurant at the beach. You have to reserve a spot and pay a little bit extra but it is definitely worth it. \n",
