      "text": "What a fantastic time we had at this resort, just purely relaxing. \n\nThis was our first time at the Sunrise Diamond Beach Resort in Sharm  (although we have stayed at equally beautiful Sunrise Resorts in Hurghada many times) and we were looked after so well.  ü•∞\n\nWe stayed in the Executive Pool Suite, both the rooms and pool were a delight. Ramy looked after our room so well and we loved his towel art.  This included the \"Posh Club\" facilities and services which we made use of every day.  Private areas on the beach and on the deck overlooking the beach.  We ate breakfast and lunch here most days and enjoyed talking with the staff over a glass or two of champagne.  Both Mustafa (the Manager) and Abd Allah made us feel so welcome and could not do enough for us.  I hope you are looking after that Champagne bottle stopper Mustafa üòÅ\n\nThe a la carte restaurants are all great and serve wonderful food but our favourites were definitely the Mongolian, what a great concept to pick all your own food and have it cooked in front of you (thank you to Samer and his staff for looking after us) and the Indian - Manohar, the Goan Shrimp Curry was amazing  (again Mustafa always made us most welcome).\n\nEvery evening after dinner we would make our way over to a couple of bar stools at The Latitue Bar to end the night with a few cocktails.  Mohamed and Mohiey worked so hard to keep all the patrons topped up with their favourite beverages and crisps and always with a smile on their faces.  It was a pleasure to get to know them a little during our stay.  Thank you for always having my favourite cocktails ready for me Mohiey and also for the dates.\n\nFinally i have to save the biggest thanks to the Superstar who is Mohamed Maher (he overseas the Posh Club and all the Restaurants) and seemed to appear everywhere, he really could not do enough to ensure we had the very best stay and that everything was to our liking üëèüèªüëèüèª\n\nThe final touch was having all our Laundry collected and returned washed and ironed the next day ready to pack so no washing to do when we got home üëôüëñüëóüëöüòÅ\n\nWe will definitely be coming back",

Every single member of the team had a smile on their face and went above the call of duty to ensure complete satisfaction. Our room attendant Mahmoud was very good, Sayed in the family pool bar along with the lifeguards are a credit to the hotel. The restaurant manager Mohamod was exceptional offering to get anything required for our fussy eating granddaughter. Hanny the Mongolian manager was also a delight to speak with. There was also a very helpful man on reception that had a smile inducing smile! We were very impressed with the cleanliness and would like to return, there aren't many places we have said that about. Absolutely no complaints from any of us.",

      "text": "Really can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough. I have have just returned after a week in Sharm with my friend and our two sons. We had the opportunity to relax and make plenty of special memories which will last a life time. \nReally can‚Äôt thank the animation team enough especially Miami who never failed to make us laugh and keep us busy. Fantastic entertainment for both children and adults both in the day and at night, the whole team work very hard to please the guests. We especially enjoyed the foam party! \nThe hotel is in a great location and offers a great variety of food, drinks and snacks. All areas of the hotel including our rooms were cleaned and tidy.\nCan‚Äôt wait to return soon‚Ä¶",
