I brought this up twice with two different staff members but they was not interested in helping not even suggesting they would help contact Expedia to explain for me! Hotel was ok but not very busy at all, entertainment staff were friendly but wasn’t many people for them to entertain! But my dad was hounded for 3 days for money from the doctor after he was put on a drip for a cough he had, he only went to ask for cough syrup! They wanted £150 excess or were threatening to charge the full £600!",

      "text": "I've stayed at this hotel twice thus far, the first time being in October 2023, and then recently in February 2024.\n\nI am very happy with this hotel. The service is of an excellent standard, I did not have any reason to complain. The staff are very helpful and engaging. \n\nACCOMMODATION/ROOM\n\nDuring my visit in October 2023, I stayed at the beachfront building. There are two, the mountainside and the beachfront. This building was closer to the beach - a 1-minute walk - and had a restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A pool bar, spa, gym, private doctor's clinic and pools.\n\nMy room was spacious, and the AC was essential! It was so hot that you could put your clothes out to dry and it'll be done within an hour! I had a balcony view on the second floor, so I could put the clothes out there safely to dry.\n\nThe TV was fully working, and there was a limited range of channels, but was hardly in the room! The mini fridge fully working, so I could put any drinks I brought from the local shops there, as well as chilled snacks. \n\nBathroom - fully working, nice spacious shower. \nBed - double and very comfortable.\nSpace - a good amount of space, with table chairs, and the wardrobes had ample space! \nSAFE - didn't work, but was soon fixed by on-site maintenance and I could store my stuff in there without any worry!\n\nDuring my staff in February 2024, the beachside building was closed for renovation, so I stayed in the mountainside.\n\nThis was the main building, reception is based here, as well as swimming pools, restaurant, a la carte restaurant, bar and entertainment. \n\nMy room was upgraded courtesy of the hotel, and I had a bigger walk-in shower, bath, balcony and slightly larger room. However, the room was on the ground floor, so didn't leave clothes out for long or when I wasn't in the room!\n\nVERY happy with the room, no complaints at all!\n\nFOOD - ALL INCLUSIVE\n\nIt's OK. I'm not going to say it's the best I've had, but I had no reason to complain. You have a good variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Soft drinks are included at the bar.\n\nThe food was cooked, hotel and I particularly liked the roast chicken, mash, fries and variety of different breads and salads. \n\nYou won't get served drinks at the table, you have to go up to the drinks area and request a soft drink. Fruit juices are available via their machines, just take a glass and help yourself, but for hot drinks, soft drinks you have to ask the staff behind that area.\n\nIf you're not careful, other guests could take your table if you're away from it for a period of time. As a solo traveller, it did happen twice, but I found other tables free, so if you're going as a couple/family, then have someone stay at the table so it's not taken!\n\nTHINGS TO DO!\n\nMy favourite bit!\n\nI love to dive/snorkel, and this hotel has so far the best house reef I've seen! The beach area is small, but you do have other parts as you walk to the entrance where you can grab a beach chair and towel and relax. You'll be given a card to hand to the staff to grab a towel, simply return your towel and they'll give your the reusable card back.\n\nThe beach starts off shallow, but the jetty goes over the coral and then at the end it's about 7.8m deep, so be weary of this. If you're not a confident swimmer, then maybe ask for a life jacket or stay close to the jetty.\n\nIf you swim out within the beach area of the hotel, you'll see two high reefs with ambundance of sea life! It's a fantastic snorkel experience and most of the fish will come up to you as they're always curious! \n\nThere is an on-site dive centre called Sinai Dive Centre. I used them for two intro dives, which was about £40-50 and lasts 25 minutes. Mustafa who is the Dive Master was amazing! He's professional, friendly and we dived at the house reef and I got to see all the other fish at the bottom, including sting rays, a lion fish (don't touch!), sand fish (another one to not touch!) and much, much more!\n\nIf you're going to dive, then be aware that you'll need to complete a medical form, and be deemed fit to dive by the centre based on your answers on the form. If you need a fit to dive from a doctor, you should do this in the UK as in Egypt this wouldn't be covered by travel insurance! \n\nBack on land... the hotel is within the vicinity of 'Soho Square' - a truly lavish array of shops, visual attractions and a great place to wonder!\n\nAll within walking distance from the hotel, you have pharmacies, supermarkets, perfume shops, souvenir shops and another dive centre.\n\nIn Soho Square, you will be amazed by all the places on offer: cafes, restaurants, mobile phone shops, carpet(!) shops, another supermarket, hotels, even an estate agent! \n\nNow the somewhat 'negative' - things are seriously a rip-off! Especially in Soho Square, be prepared to haggle, but there will be a limit up to which the traders will no longer haggle, after which it's a 'take it or leave it'. They're not allowed to hassle the tourists, and there's security check points around the square, hotels and entrance/exits, so you're safe!\n\nThere is an amazing water fountain display, which reacts to music with lights! Kids will love it as well as the grown-ups. Next to it are ice cream stalls for Gelato, and a waffle place!\n\nFinally, in October 2023 I did venture out to the McDonalds, which is a taxi ride away, approx £12-14. I didn't venture out on my recent trip, to be honest, I was entertained within the square. \n\nIf you want to plan excursions, the hotel can help you with this, or your tour guide. Remember, keep it official, so try to avoid anyone 'off the street', and if you want security, then book the taxi from the hotel (they have a private taxi firm there), but if you want it cheaper, then catch a taxi on the street outside of the square! The taxis in the car park outside of the hotel are all private. The public taxis are coloured differently, the hotel will advise you.\n\nWEATHER\n\nOctober 2023 - high 30s!!\nFebruary 2024 - high 20s!!\n\nMessage - always hot and wonderful! Excellent weather!!\n\nSAFETY\n\nSharm-el-Sheikh at the time of writing this is a safe city. It's surprisingly small! Compared to Luxor, Cairo etc, it's the main tourist area, and Egypt takes tourism very seriously. It's the main income of the economy, so you will have police and security presence not only around your hotel, but outside in the city.\n\nIt's safe to walk around, even in the markets, obviously, always be alert, it is a foreign country! But there is issues or problems from any of the neighbouring conflicts, you're quite a distance away from it.",
