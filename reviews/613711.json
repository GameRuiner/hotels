We were able to watch some of the ‚ÄúHolly Week‚Äù processions right from our balcony. For exploring beyond the Gothic Quarter, the hotel‚Äôs proximity to metro stations was a huge plus. Despite being in the middle of Barcelona‚Äôs hustle and bustle, stepping inside this hotel, it is peaceful and tranquil. Amazing. \n\nThe staff were great. Whether we needed recommendations for local restaurants or assistance with transportation, they were always ready to help. They were always friendly and greeted us each day as we came in and out. \n\nThe breakfast buffet is very good. The spread was diverse, offering freshly baked pastries, assorted meats and cheeses, Spanish tortillas, a variety of fruits, and you can even ask for made-to-order eggs.\n\nIn summary, if you‚Äôre looking for a well-located, friendly, and comfortable stay in Barcelona, this hotel is an excellent choice. I highly recommend it!",
