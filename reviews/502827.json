      "text": "I apologise for it taking so long for me to write this review. We arrived at this hotel very late at night. The staff at reception very very friendly and helpful and helped us to our room. I should add that my mother has walking difficulties and we had some stairs into the room, but we didn‚Äôt care, as the room, and view from the room was amazing.  The very next morning at breakfast, the manager came to see us and upgraded out room so my mum didn‚Äôt need to climb stairs. If you can imagine, all the staff were as thoughtful and kind the whole holiday, which made this holiday very special indeed. The facilities here were great, the views and infinity pool, beautiful. The food here was also on another level, chefs would speak to guests and listen to what people liked. The speciality restaurant made for one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had. I can only applaud the management for what they are trying to achieve with their customer service, as this made our experience much more memorable. I would love to be able to come back again.",

      "text": "Well.... I'll start with the positives: amazing views, the jetty to sit and relax on and the option to swim in the sea was the highlight of the holiday for us, truly beautiful and serene.\nNow it all depends on what you want from a holiday,  for us it was a break from our very busy and demanding jobs, a week to unwind and relax and that we definitely did, however this is far from a 5* hotel, its just simply not at that standard. Not a high level of cleanliness anywhere nor health and safety as found loose floor tiles, beach area dirty and not easy to walk along, stair rails loose, steps into the sea and pools loose.  Now whether it's because its approaching the end of the season (I really shouldn't have to make excuses for them) but it really felt everyone had given up and couldn't be bothered. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms which was beautiful to be fair but you do get for free the bonus of hearing other rooms make a coffee, have a shower and flush the toilet!\nThe rooms were cleaned as and when, the duvet didn't even fit the width of the bed so we had to ask for another. We had to ask for more toilet roll, probably wouldn't have needed more had we not both been struck with food poisoning on two separate days during our week stay! \nThe food although a good selection was not always hot and I had the suspicion that dishes were made up from the previous nights leftovers.\nMorning omelettes were OK if you like raw egg! \nThe staff always seem really eager to clear your plates even if others on your table are still eating? Maybe they have a limited supply of crockery??? \nOn a couple of occasions the restaurant ran out of fruit juices and the beach bar ran out of ice cream, Limited to a choice of vanilla or chocolate! \nThere are no drinks menus anywhere so if you're looking for a cocktail be ready to get either a sweet or sour cocktail.\nThere is also no inside bar so as everything is outside it can get chilly and people seem to smoke where they please so not ideal if you're not a smoker, they also smoke at meal times on the restaurant balcony so sit inside if you don't want Fag Ash Lil sat next to you during your meals.\nThe only place to pick up towels is in the spa reception which is not near the infinity pool or the beach??? \nAnd although the infinity pool is gorgeous, you must be a lover of gansta rap music  (certain words not always blanked out)\nThe place is run down and is in need of some love and money spending on it. \nWould we come back? Probably not.\nWe've been lucky enough to visit other 5* resorts in Turkey and they far outway this one and like I said definitely not worth the 5*rating it has been given.\nI also don't expect to see Tip Boxes dotted around a 5* resort!!!\nI'd expect a lot more for my money.
