      "text": "Location is wonderful, by sea side\nLoads of restaurants and cafes around\nEasy to walk to many locations \nHotel concept is bohemian and sweet, but shower is leaking, room wasn’t clean, full of hair and cigarette ashes (we don’t smoke), electric sockets and night lamps are falling apart. Hotel requires some serious refurbishment. \nGenerally it is a nice place with some cons that could be fixed easily. If management takes comments into consideration, it would be a great hotel to stay at",
