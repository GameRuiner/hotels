      "text": "The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the hotel doesn't have a lift but just request a lower floor room. Great hotel,brilliant breakfast,kettle, mini fridge,TV,great shower and lovely restaurant attached where you can grab a lovely coffee. Balcony was a bit small but okay to grab fresh air. Lovely sitting area on the 2nd floor,strong WiFi. 10 minutes to the seafront 5 minutes to kulturpark and Luna park.staff are all lovely, beds are really comfy,would stay here again.",

      "text": "It was a good one night stay in Izmir. Central location, less than 10 mins walk from the station if you bring the luggages. Walking distance (~25 mins) to many tourist spots including the port, bazaar, clock tower, the ruins, and elevator). Modern and good size bathroom with reliable hot water pressure. The room is not big but has all amenities needed, including own balcony. As it is located in the alley off 2 main streets, it is relatively quiet in the evening. Varieties of local style breakfast. The only challenge is it is using stairs so if you have many big luggages, you may want to ask for lower levels. \n\nBig shoutout to Ms Jeren (?), the receptionist, who were cheerful and very helpful by personally supporting me on transport issue. It was such a great help and make my short transit in Izmir smooth and easy!",

      "text": "Piano Hotel in Izmir is situated in a wonderful location, just 650 metres from the Basmane gar train station and is an amazing choice for travellers who wish to explore the beauty of Izmir on foot. The seaside is just 15-20 minutes of walking along some of the most beautiful streets in the city. The historical Kemeralti bazar, the Smyrna Agora are all within walking distance. It was a pleasure checking into this beautiful neatly decorated hotel that has a wonderful receptionist who can provide you with all the information required. It is easy to catch a bus and reach the Izmir Otogar, if one wishes to visit Alacati and Illica or Cesme on their own. The hotel has tours for Ephesus as well. We even tried out the Fes Spa and Hamam on recommendation of the hotel reception, and it turned out to be really great.\n\nI liked their room service and the wonderful charming cafe, where we used to relax after roaming around the city throughout the day. The tables with a view of the street were our personal favourite. I wish I could go back to this amazing hotel once more to enjoy the same streets once more! Thank you Piano Hotel for making our stay so comfortable and pleasurable. ",
