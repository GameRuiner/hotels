The hotel itself is very ly dark and the rooms are the equivalent of staying at your grandparents house guest bedroom. Very cluttered and mismatch of furniture and lighting. Also, we had a smell in our room and others I overheard complain as well. One of the staff said it had something to do with the sinks. They fixed ours but it’s not something that should happen frequently at a hotel. I wouldn’t stay here again unless it was a very low price per night.",

      "text": "What a disappointment.  After reading the rave reviews on this property, I canceled a reservation in another hotel and decided to stay here. Unfortunately, none of the positive reviews were true for me.  I was offered a chance to upgrade the room a week ago, which I did.  When I got to the front desk they said it wasn't available, but I had just heard them give an upgrade to the person in front of me, who hadn't even asked for it.  I came directly from the airport at 11 am, and did not expect to get into my room that early.  But I was treated like an inconvenience, not the friendliness that was touted in all the other reviews.  My view, shown in the picture, is of a corner of the building next door which juts out in front of my window. I had to go the lobby to post this, as there is no internet in my room. And the onsite restaurant is only open certain days, which is not mentioned on their website.  I will be moving to another hotel in the morning.",

        "text": "Dear Ann K G,\n\nWe are truly sorry to learn by your comment in Trip Advisor that the hotel does not meet your expectations. We wish you could have given us the opportunity to check together all your concerns and work on a resolution.\n\nI would like to cover all the points mentioned so you have a better understanding of the hotel services and procedures.\n\nFirstly, in regards of the room type, you booked a King Superior room and requested a junior suite paying the price difference. The request was denied by the hotel due to the lack of availability, and you did not have a confirmation of your request. On the other hand, as a gold member you have the benefit of have a free upgrade to a better room upon checkin time under availability, however the hotel did not have any option for 4 nights as the last two nights of your stay the hotel was almost full. You overhead a conversation with another guest who had a shorter stay and there are many factors to take under consideration: room type booked, length of stay, profile preferences…\nWe allocated you in our newest floor that has been renovated in 2024 facing our back yard, which you have partial view of the pool area in spite of not being showed in the picture posted.\n\nRegarding the restaurant, we have 3 F&B outlets where food and drinks are offered: Solomillo restaurant, Charcuteria Bar and Patio Bar. Charcuteria Bar located at the lobby is open daily until 12am. All this information is available in the welcome letter provided at checkin. Any of our staff could have resolved this query with pleasure.\nAdditionally, the opening days and hours of the Solomillo Restaurant is certainly informed in our website, you can find it in the department Restaurants along with the rest.\n\nI apologize if the service when you arrived was not friendly. I can assure you that we genuinely take care of all our guests, and it is a pleasure to us. The room was not ready at 11am and we gave priority to your room as soon as you arrived as we were not aware of your arrival time. At 12:50pm, we were able to provide you an early checkin, 2 hours before the official checkin time.\n\nFinally, the hotel Wi-Fi is also new and fast. If there is any inconvenience, there is a technical support available 24h. If you had informed us and gave us the opportunity to check your connectivity with phone or PC, making sure the correct network is chosen and in case of need, being assisted by a support agent, we could have resolved the situation.\n\nWe will be pleased to welcome you back in future stays in Barcelona and offer a memorable stay with us.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCarlota Monter\nFront Desk Manager",
