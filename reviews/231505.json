I liked their coffee machine.\nBut their room interior was very very bad. I mean the hotel room was good but it hadn't any interior design. I think in Gaudi's city and 4stars hotel, the hotel's room must have beautiful interior design.",

My experience was totally positive- all the reception staff were extremely helpful - recommencing restaurants etc - the breakfast staff were courteous and efficient. The room was large and comfortable and the little balcony was a gorgeous place for a cold glass of wine on the evening. The position of the hotel is excellent. I would definitely stay again. ",

      "text": "Haven't been there, but was thinking of staying at this place for 3 weeks, as the aparthotel I usually stay at, may not be available. I go to Barcelona frequently, so I was anxious to check out a different property in the same general area. \n\nOn July 31, I contacted the property, asking 4 critical questions, my reservation depending on all 4 answers. I had thoroughly checked their websitre and booking conditions and it was a little confusing, which is why decided to ask the questions\n\nI used to live in Barcelona, for many years and the location of this property is very convenient,\n\nA week later, I got a convoluted email, only answering ONE of the questions! Well, that's not very helpful.  I waited another week and still no answer on the other questions.  I sent them another email, asking the 3 remaining questions again. Still no answer.\n\nThis is when I decided to check reviews.  Should have done that first time around!  If I had, I would have never contacted the property, and therefore, no longer care if they answer me or not. I have zero confidence in the management of this property, who seemingly don't much care about potential customers\n\nThere absolutely no way I would ever stay there or recommend it. I will keep my fingers crossed that the plac eI normally stay will have availability. I wasn't sure if it was acceptable for me to mention this other propertly, so I didn't\n\nMy advice to you, don't only decide on the basis of other reviews to begin with. One of them states this was not a very convenient place, no restaurants, no shopping nearby. Honestly, There is a lot of shopping nearby and is walking distance to a subway station. It's a fabulous part of town. Still I would never considering staying there!.  Do your own research, not only Tripadvisor reviews!",
