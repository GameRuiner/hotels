Stain on the bathrobe was a cherry on the top. Apart from that stuff was nice. Room was big and bright. Location is near to the sea - 5 min walk distance-. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast is also good. Could be even a nice hotel if it was cleaner! I woulndn't come back because there are many other hotels in the same price range nearby and would not give another shot to this place!",
