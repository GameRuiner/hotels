The rooms are knights quarters, and hence could not be modified due to the heritage listing. However the lounge and dining areas have been beautifully restored. The place has such a wonderful ambience of history which makes it so special to stay there. What made our stay even more enjoyable was the hospitality of the owner, Savvas. He provided the best breakfasts, with jams made by his Mum from her own produce, wonderful selection of breads, his own Rhodian bread, and his amazing omelettes which were different every day. He helped us with our transport and much more. Thank you Savvas for looking after us and making our stay in Rhodes one to remember.",
