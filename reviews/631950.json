      "text": "A small 3-star hotel where you get the feeling that you are staying at home. We stayed at Falcon Hills for 14 nights, but it felt like 2 months. Super friendly and helpful staff! We met such nice people at the hotel (both the staff and other guests who visit this hotel 5, 10, 50 times already)! The reason why I like to visit smaller 3-4 star hotels rather than big 5 star hotels is that you get to know the staff and the local culture better. Special thanks to Samir (handsome guy with a nice haircut, works on the terrace of the restaurant), I will remember you forever ❤. Thanks to Eslam for 5 star service in a 3 star hotel 😊. Many thanks also to the other hotel staff, thanks to whom our vacation was so pleasant and we felt like we were staying at home.\nAlways remember to treat people the way you want to be treated!\nThe only downside was that our bed linen was never changed during the 14 days. But I am sure that if we had contacted the hotel reception, it would have been done immediately.\nThank you Falcon Hills for such a great vacation! An unforgettable experience!",
