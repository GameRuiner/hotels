      "text": "Stayed at the front side of the hotel near the pool! It was a pleasure to be here for 10 days. The hotel is beautifully maintained, has amazing views and various options for food so you definitely will not get hungry :) The rooms are clean, had no problems. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The staff are absolutely amazing too, hardworking and always trying their best to give you the best experience and we want to say a big thank you to them. A massive thank you especially goes to the one and only AHMED who works at the pool bar, he became our family from day 1 of arrival. We have never met such a kind and caring person before. He is always greeting everyone with the biggest smile on his face and creating our order before we even have approached the bar. So thoughtful and generous of him. Thank you for everything! We miss you already and hope to return back in the future :)",

We stayed in a deluxe room with 2 large doubles and lots of space.\nLittle one loved the kids club which had a variety of activities and staff were very attentive.\nThe snorkelling was fantastic and the beach was perfect for us all.\nBig shout out to Ahmed at the pool bar, my little one is still talking about him now! \nAlso be sure to visit Ali Baba at Nefertiti's little shop down on the beach!\nWe'll be back next year.",

Gardens are extremely well maintained. \nThe rooms we had were very clean and quiet albeit they were starting to show the signs of use.\nThe food was perfectly fine although it did get a bit repetitive and the kids struggled somewhat.\nThe waiters worked hard and would reserve a table for you without being asked which was a great gesture.\nA special mention to Ahmed at the pool bar who was always there with a smile and often with a drink ready if he saw us approaching.\nOverall a lovely experience (and so great to get away from the dreary British weather) and would return.",

      "text": "Another great holiday!\n\nThe hotel and staff amazing. Room was still nice even though we didn’t go for the deluxe this time just a sea view. \n\nA few familiar faces after our last trip. We were looked after every day at the swim up bar by the amazing Ahmed and his team and by the staff staff on an evening. It was my birthday while we were away and my husband arranged a free cake with the customer relations team. This was given to me down at the pool bar and Ahmed had arranged to play happy birthday which was a lovely touch. \n\nBuffet food was average and got the fresh omelette for breakfast most days. The BBQ in the Flame restaurant was very good and the view was amazing.  We ate from the a la carte meal at the Italian which was also brilliant. \n\nOnly down side is being constantly harassed by people trying to get you to purchase things. The worst of them all were staff from the salon pushing their massage service. It was several times a day often by the same person despite being told no. If they would have just had a price list and left me alone I may have considered it. \n\nOnce again we ended up with multiple mosquito bites so go well prepared and cover yourself in repellent. \n\nPool was freezing but bearable once you were in. Pool staff were also attentive. We decided to visit the sports hotel via the shuttle bus which leaves about every 15 mins I think. It is literally across the road to the right but there is quite a long drive down so 10 mins walk if not longer. The hotel across wasn’t anywhere near as good as the front hotel. They were doing maintenance work in the areas near the pool which can’t be helped but made me glad I wasn’t staying there. The security guy in the door was very friendly and chatted while we were waiting for the bus. \n\nWe visited Soho square again which is 10 mins away. We decided to have a look during the day and how different it looked! Most shops were closed but was good to see it in daylight and gave us an excuse to walk out. We also visited Farsha cafe which is a mountain cafe about 15-20 mins away by taxi- amazing!\n\nOverall another amazing holiday. It also showed us how devoted the staff are to their faith. The weather was late 20’s most days and our trip was during Ramadan. We really felt for the staff fasting but it did not affect their work in anyway.\n\nWould definitely visit again 👍",
