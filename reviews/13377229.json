      "text": "Spent the night before leaving Turkey on March 27. \ngreat location, can be a little loud as is on the main artery going to the airport in a very busy area of the city. \nIt is actually a large building with different blocks including and sharing the restaurant facilities with Engine Hotel. Free parking at the rear.\nThis is not a seasonal hotel, it is open and busy year round. clean, modern, 24-7 service. Nothing to complain, all good from the staff to accommodation and restaurant. Restaurant was very busy in the mooning, there were a few groups checking out, just like us, at 8:00 am.\nThere is everything you need around, again it is in a very busy area with shops, restaurants and shopping malls. We picked a very good sea food restaurant, a block away, very good choice. Fully recommended!",

      "text": "Our family of five (with three teenage daughters) booked two rooms at the Extenso as a one night stay on arrival from Izmir airport. I made the reservation well in advance (DEC 2018) for October 2019 (half-term break) - it was perfect for us as we were then easily able to catch the train the following morning to Selcuk/Ephesus. Responsive e-mail correspondence. Very good price for a double and triple room (combined total of about £88 at the then exchange rate - about 7.35 TL to the £ -  including breakfast). The rooms were modern, spacious and very clean - the hotel itself seems relatively new. The girls' triple room on the top floor was amazing, with a huge, wrap-around balcony. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful - one of the guys at the desk even drove us and our luggage round the corner to the IZBAN/Train station (very close anyway but a nice gesture). Especially liked the extensive breakfast - great selection. The main chef seemed super-proud of what was on offer and spent time helping my wife and daughters make choices regarding some of the unfamiliar food selections. Delicious and typically Turkish.\nThe location is perfect in terms of being a literal, 5 mins walk from the IZBAN stop. You climb up the steps out the station and the Extenso is directly in front (albeit across a main road which needs navigating). This is a business hotel and is geared up for that type of clientele accordingly but this was absolutely not a problem for us. Noise-wise, the hotel is on a busy, main road and I guess it could potentially be a problem for light sleepers (if you prefer to sleep with the window open). However, we were fine. Overall, an excellent value hotel that ticked all the boxes for us - a great first night on our week-long trip in Turkey. Highly recommended.",
