      "text": "My wife and I stay here for 5 nights: 1 night before going to Madrid and 4 nights on return from Madrid. Nice clean room with room safe. Provided a big bottle of drinking water and an electric kettle.  Lots of table top spaces, which suits our needs as well table for cabin bags.  Very friendly staff.  The heater is not warm enough for winter times. Would better to have a box of tissue paper instead of a small packet.  Stainless steel stool enables easier scrubbing of feet but shower cubical has no door, causing  floor outside the cubical to  be wet when showing.  Ought to have door or at least floor length curtain.  Strange that after 1st day, no free bottle of water and no tissue paper.  This is against the idea of encouraging guests to stay more days.",

      "text": "Our stay was outstanding! While we loved the hotel location (easy walking to restaurants/bars/cafes), the facilities and our room; it was the staff who absolutely deserve a shoutout for their amazing customer service! The front desk staff of Victor and Javier were great with answering questions, calling a cab and just being there with a willingness to pitch in and help whenever and wherever needed. Speaking of pitching in we would be remiss to not thank Marcel and Isaac for their assistance in helping us with luggage, making a drink at the bar, finding us and iron and ironing board; to just being ready to help us and other guests at any time. Food wise we have high praise for Dayana who was nothing but smiles and making sure we were well taken care of to even herself being there to play bartender when needed. My wife and I can't speak highly enough about just how friendly, professional, accommodating and helpful this hotel's staff is.  We would not hesitate to recommend it and stay there ourselves again. This was a very high end customer service experience for a very fair price. Thanks so much!",

There is no restaurant in the hotel, the swimming pool is terribly located (in the yard, in a shady place, surrounded by slum-like tenement houses) and very small with cold water. View from the window of the building in a very close distance. There are homeless people and drunks in the park next to the hotel - which is dangerous. Rooms very small, but ok. Breakfast was good, but not great. Nice service.\nBut I will definitely not return to this hotel. Generally, I do not recommend it to someone who likes to have a comfortable stay.",
