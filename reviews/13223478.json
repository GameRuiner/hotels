      "text": "Visited this weekend for my daughters 21st Birthday. The staff were fabulous from the moment we arrived. So pleasant and welcoming. They had even left a birthday treat in our room which was spotlessly clean.\nThe location couldn't have been better. \nOur only small gripe was the roof terrace. Whilst it is stunning and a welcome addition to a central hotel, €72 for 4 cocktails, patatas bravas and a caesar salad seems excessive. My burger and her steak on one night were not cooked as asked either. Staff however did take away and cook further without issues. \n\nOverall, highly recommended. What made it for us, was the staff.",
