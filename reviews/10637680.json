      "text": "Excellent hotel in a superb location for our business visit :stay from Sept 20 till Sept 23 in king junior suite 2002 ( paid with HH points ) \n\nHighways are in easy distance so driving to Izmir town or to çesme is very easy . \nThis hotel is near the airport ( 10 minute drive)and IMHO ideal to be used as basecamp to go explore around Izmir area and perfectly situated for going on easy day-drives discovering all interesting sites in an 100 km radius !\n\nEspecially housekeeping was at an unexpectedly high 'Conrad standard' during our entire stay . Fantastic cleaning and putting everything in order by ANETA & AYSUN !! Dilek even helped us on check out( Sept. 23 ) to bring my wife's suitcase all the way to the elevator :) \n\nFree underground parking with cc and closed gate kept our car cool and protected while we were in our room so extra plus point . \n\nBreakfast was very good and fresh in quality ;  also had very good & tasty choices of local food and superb ripe fruit ( melon and water- ) . \n\nFront desk staff was very friendly on check in ( at 11:55 pm !!) and also at check out with very efficient process plus handling all our requests and questions.\nE-mail sent to hotel was promptly replied to by ass. front desk manager ( THX Mrs Barbak ! ) and even if upgrade was not possible because suite was booked we still felt very welcome as HH Diamond members .\n\ne-mail =  fo@dtbhizmirairport.com    info@izmirairportdoubletreebyhilton.com",
