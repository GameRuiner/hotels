      "text": "The Good: I'll start with a mention of Amr, the rooftop barman is the greatest asset to this hotel that I'm sure is underappreciated by management. Calmly in control, efficient, personable and good at his job. The beers were always cold, surely this should be the standard, and rarely ran out. The roof top pool and deck is a fantastic place to sun with ample loungers and the best views. Management need to do a bit of maintenance as there are a couple of screws sticking up and I picked up 2 sizeable splinters when walking barefoot. \nThe room was very nice, comfortable bed and kept clean, mostly to a good level. Free programmable safe and a fridge with water bottles replenished daily. Unfortunately though, there was no milk sachets to have tea.\nThe restaurant food was varied and very acceptable for an all inclusive hotel. There is a beach level area with sun loungers and a bar and has direct access to the bay to swim and snorkel which is also a definite plus. For these things I would consider staying here again.\n\nThe Bad: There is a venue called Kalimera, part of Marina Sharm Hotel, which hosts late night parties to 1/2am on a Tue and Friday- Bring earplugs or you wont get to sleep. I heard the rooftop rooms can hardly hear it. \nThere is an almighty rush to get into the restaurant as it opens in the evening as if the food is going to run out. I think this is so they can get out and reserve seats for the 'entertainment' which is really poor. From excessively loud Karaoke to an excessively loud mediocre DJ. There was some really good dancers one eve but that was the only thing worth watching.\n\nThe Unbearable: The main evening and entertainment bar insists on 'pouring' lightly chilled (at best) beers as quickly as possible to create maximum froth into a half sized tumbler glass, so each beer ordered is probably less than 200ml. Shocking.. This is unbearable. Once Amr called from the rooftop bar to make sure they made the beers cold. They were, for the half hour before supper. After that, they were back to normal. They run out of beer regularly and restocked beers are off the shelf. I switched to Vodka  Orange one eve. The orange is undrinkable and I went off to buy replacement 'fresh' orange. After 2 drinks they 'ran out of vodka'!! Just unbelievably bad. \"would I like Whiskey or Rum?\" Not kidding. Because of this I will almost certainly not stay here again. I'd rather pay for all my beers as long as they are cold and a proper size.",
