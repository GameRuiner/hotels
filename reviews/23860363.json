      "text": "Planed to have Iftar at this hotel , when we reached there they said it‚Äôs a buffet and than was surprised that is √† la carte . No choice with poor menu with only Indian cuisine , my wife asked for Cesar salad and she received  water melon one , waiters was confused and with very low level of product knowledge and communication , very annoying also . \nMy car unfortunately in the parking had and issue and coudin‚Äôt start it , went to reception and asked a lady at the guest relation desk on Iftar time  if she can ask hotel maintenance team to help me out and she simply said we don‚Äôt have anyone check outside , by myself was asking the valet parking and they guided me to a gentleman in basement 4 who tried to help me and I want to thank him at least for his effort .\n \nWent up to the restaurant again and asked for bill and I paid by card. While exiting the restaurant my self and my wife , waiter was shouting ( wait .. wait .. wait .. ). Very rudely  , and it‚Äôs like we are arrested there , the gentleman didn‚Äôt change the paper roll In his POS machine and the slip was not printed properly which is obviously his mistake while I showed them the transaction deducted already from my account , than a supervisor tried to apologize after having this mess . \n\nWent down to parking after calling pick up car assistance and valet parking was not helpful , straight he was asking me about a Mercedes car parked there long time ago which I don‚Äôt know at all and I‚Äôm not concerned ( he was thinking that it belong to me ) which really very annoying  , he made us waiting and was shooting even saying bad words just because he want priorities other guest cars to exit the parking . \n\nTo the higher management, your hotel is catastrophic, your services are the lowest , your team are bellow the minimum levels . \n\nIt‚Äôs beautiful hotel in the heart of Dubai and you are going to affect the nice image of services and hospitality  that we all know in the country .",
