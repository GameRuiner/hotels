      "text": "This is a lovely hotel set in the hills above Barcelona. We had an amazing corner suite which gave us wonderful views of Barcelona and the sea.\n\nThe furnishings are beautiful and high quality. Apparently next year is their centenary and they  are planning a big refurb but hopefully more maintenance rather than changing too much. \n\nThe staff are superb - the moment you walk in, you are made to feel welcome and ‘special’. They are incredibly helpful and go out of their way to make your stay memorable.\n\nIt feels a very luxurious hotel - we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was perfect. \n\nWe will definitely be returning next year.",

      "text": "Amazing hotel, the building stands out at the top of the mountain and can be seen standing above Barcelona!  Our suite was lovely with beautiful views of the city from every window! At night the city lit up was stunning.  Huge comfortable bed, plenty of towels and toiletries provided.  Staff amazing, helpful and friendly, Ferran gave us lots of information about the city and where to go!  Lovely spa, swimming pool, jacuzzi, gym eqtsnd sauna with everything provided.  And finally the restaurant, had the most delicious meal, food beautifully presented and tasted devine, with impeccable service. Only thing you need to be aware of is that you need to get a taxi to and from Barcelona city, on average €30 a time  but using the FREENOW app was useful and take the price not the metered method and that can be a lot more!  But the hotel stay is more than worth the taxi rides!",

The most impressive is the views of the city and water from the terrace and rooms. The Spa is luxurious and the massage will dissolve the worst jet leg and make you feel amazing.  Book here for a stay or come for dinner or a drink to watch the sunset. City lights at night are spectacular too.",

      "text": "Stayed for 2 nights. The Mountain View room was not as described which we sorted so that was good. The views from the hotel are amazing as are the staff in the restaurants and on reception. We also loved the very cold pool. \nThe good ends there! \nThis is a 5 star hotel which feels like it’s about to close. The main restaurant was shut leaving very few real dining options and it is somewhat isolated. The terrace bar and restaurant offer mediocre food… much of which was cooked from frozen shop bought. Room service menu is very limited too. \nThe rooms are a little tired and our shower was very old and in need of new fittings. \nHotel publicises an airport shuttle- there isn’t one. Also publicises coffee machine. First room didn’t have one , second one did but the 2 pods on arrival are not replaced unless you pay 3 euros per pod. \nSimply not at all 5 star",
