From the moment we were greeted by Mario at the reception desk, to the tremendous service by Zhanna at the Mood Rooftop Bar, our experience at The One was first class. The hotel is gorgeous and the room was fantastic. Great linens, sitting area and bathroom. Breakfast at the Somni Restaurant was delicious and very well prepared. The staff is first class and bellmen are well trained. The One made our stay in Barcelona very enjoyable and I would highly recommend.",

Super friendly and happy to help at every opportunity. I’d highly recommend using the concierge service to help in getting good quality restaurant bookings. They really know their stuff. \nThe hotel breakfast was nice and provided plenty. Don’t worry if you don’t use the hotels breakfast as there is plenty of coffee shops and bakery’s near by. \nLovely rooftop bar and restaurant which does lovely food and great cocktails in a picture perfect setting. Highly recommend taking a trip up in the afternoon to see the city skyline. \nWould definitely return to this hotel when staying in Amsterdam",

The rooms were very clean and had a nice city view. They paid attention to the details in the room including all the 5-star amenities that you can think of (pencil-sharpener, full-size body cream, glass bottled water, plush robes/slippers...). What made our stay most enjoyable was the concierge crew. They gave us the best restaurant suggestions, helped make all the reservations (and even cancellations). And...a BIG shoutout to Enrique, he was super friendly, helpful, and attentive. In addition, the hotel location was superb, it was a short walk to many places. We would definitely stay there again!",
