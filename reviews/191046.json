      "text": "Beautiful hotel and centrally located. Smelled fabulous (bother front desk about finding out the fragrance and it was a hidden secret). Room was clean and spacious.  Ac nor heat was available since weather was mixed with 60s in day and 40s in night. Had a room overlooking Las Ramblas and that was a show for sure. A bit loud at night so bring earplugs.  Got to see the Palm Sunday parade right from our window twice. Lots of great restaurants nearby.  Nextdoor at Moxy ask for Brittany she is absolutely awesome!! Food is delicious!!! Go see Barcelona...it is beautiful!!",

      "text": "In our many past visits to Barcelona we always stayed at Le Meridien on Rambla. This time we decided to try smth new in the same area . Searching on the web , I came across Rivolo Rambla and I especially liked the wide terrace for some rooms with a view over Rambla and Barcelona’s skyline. \n\nSo I booked a double bed comfort room. And it was the right decision. \n\nThe hotel is located right on the Rambla, across Carrefour supermarket. \n\nWe arrived at 11 am and the room was ready at about 1 pm. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and the amenities. It is pretty big  for the central hotel, lots of sunlight and air. Since it was on the 6th floor with a wide terrace with a table and chairs  it made our stay so much more enjoyable. Having breakfast or a smoke on the terrace is priceless . I don’t think there is any other hotel in the vicinity who can offer the same experience (except for super expensive suites in Le Meridien). \n\nThe only downside of the room was on the 7th floor there is a bar and when they start moving the furniture and cleaning there, you can hear all of that noise. Same for vacuum cleaning of the corridors. But the walls between the rooms were sound proof . May be the management can take a note ask its cleaning staff to be more respectful to the guests’ comfort. \n\nThe front office were nice guys and girls . It was always good to talk to them. \n\n We didn’t  have breakfast there . \n\nAlso, the hotel doesn’t have parking so you will need to park somewhere nearby - there are several underground parking in all directions. You can purchase a weekly pass for about 80 euro . Which we did. Cheaper 3 times than parking in a hotel garage. \n\nThe decor of the hotel may look simple but it is functional and tasty in the Barcelona style. \n\nWe loved it and it looks like  it has become our favourite hotel in Barcelona. We will certainly be back. \n\nI want to mention specifically Maite in the reservation dpt who was very nice even before we came , and I suspect she allocated us a great room. Much appreciated!",
