      "text": "I spent 7 nights in this hotel. What I liked most was the best customer service especially form the receptionist staff, they were all very helpful each time I raised any concerns for example I requested to change a room due to poor drainage in the bathroom and this was sorted to the earliest.\n\nSecondly the hotel is clean and the breakfast was very taste with variety.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nWas that I requested the domestic cleaner Rawande ( He was cleaning the first floor)  to change my cups and tea spoon as they were dirty, he instead informed that cups in the rooms are not changed and took them to the bathroom and washed them with the gloves he had on ,no washing up liquid and washing sponge was used. I found this unhygienic with poor infection control skills ,I suggest hotel should have a dish washer were cups are washed and as domestic cleaner come to clean room they should also  have some clean cups to replace dirty ones than washing them in the bedroom sinks.\n\nSecondly the domestic cleaners need more training especially on how to clean the sinks in the bathroom. The design of the sinks in the bedroom is quit difficult  for cleaner to clean ,they need to clean inside the sink with sponge as I found that both rooms I occupied the sinks lacked better cleaning. I even showed one cleaner what to do.\n\nSome bathroom carpets like the one I had on the first floor needs changing as its looks old.",
