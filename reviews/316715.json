      "text": "This is a fantastic hotel. It is clean and the food is great. The location is also good; close to the beach and local restaurants, but there is also a bus stop outside the hotel with regular buses to Rhodes Town that takes around 10 minutes. What really made this hotel for us though was the staff. Every member of staff works very hard to make guests feel welcome. Special mention to Vasilles in the restaurant who, despite having so much to do, always took the time to speak with us and made sure we had a table ready.\n\nMy wife has gluten and dairy food allergies and the hotel staff couldn't do more to cater for her. Every morning, the lady at the pancake station would make my wife fresh pancakes with a special free from mix. And every evening, at least one of the chefs (sometimes three!) would walk her around the buffet and explain which items were gluten and dairy free. My wife is always nervous eating out in public at fear of getting unwell, but the staff at Sol Cosmopolitan were very accommodating and put her mind at ease.\n\nOn our \"last\" day, we got talking to the hotel manager/owner who was really friendly. He seemed genuinely interested in our feedback and wanted to know that my wife had been taken care of at meal times with her allergies in mind. Our flight home had been cancelled due to a fire at Luton Airport. The hotel manager made sure we were able to get another room and extend our stay by one more night, brilliant! Roula and Agapitos were really helpful to make sure this wasn't stressful for us. \n\nOverall, would definitely recommend the Sol Cosmopolitan! ",

      "text": "We were drawn to your hotel by the numerous positive reviews, but unfortunately, our stay did not meet our expectations.\n\nFirstly, the hotel is advertised as a 4-star establishment, but based on our experience, we would rate it closer to 3 stars. The cleanliness of our room and bathroom left much to be desired, as we found hair on the bed sheet and encountered a broken and unclean fridge. These issues fell short of the standards we expected from a 4-star hotel.\n\nMoreover, the standard of our room was disappointing for a hotel of this caliber. We consistently faced a shortage of cups and cutlery for both breakfast and dinner, and the restaurant's cleanliness left much to be desired.\n\nOne of the most disheartening aspects of our stay was the fact that, in order to receive new bedding, we were required to strip the sheets and pillow covers ourselves. This lack of basic room service was unexpected for a hotel claiming to be 4 stars. \n \n\nAdditionally, I'd like to highlight that we had neighbors who smoked on the balcony, which was quite disruptive for us. This leads me to suggest that the hotel should consider allocating separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers. Furthermore, we observed a similar issue by the pool area, where there were children running around. It might be beneficial to designate certain areas as non-smoking zones, ensuring a more pleasant experience for all guests. I believe this is an aspect that the hotel management should seriously contemplate.\n\nGiven the hotel's promising location by the sea, it is with regret that I must express my hesitation in recommending it. The overall experience did not align with the expectations set by a 4-star establishment. We believe there is a clear need for improvement in several areas to match the expected standards of your guests.\n\nI hope you take this feedback as an opportunity for growth and enhancement, as we genuinely wish for future guests to enjoy a more fulfilling and satisfying stay at the Sol Cosmopolitan Hotel.",
