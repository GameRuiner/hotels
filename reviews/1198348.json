      "text": "Best Value for Money holiday I have ever booked. The hotel is undergoing massive renovations and although the room I was given had not yet been upgraded the rest of the hotel and staff made up for it. \n\nHotel has an army of staff for cleaning / serving which means you never have to wait to get served and all hotel grounds are very well maintained. \n\nThere is a huge variety of fish on the hotel’s private beach so if you like snorkelling you will have a great time. They also have a jetty and when the sea is calm you can snorkel for free next to a reef that falls 30 meter deep. It’s an amazing sight. \n\nIf you experience any issues then I recommend you immediately bring it to the attention of staff as they were very good in handling all my issues/requests promptly.   The entire hotel staff were absolutely amazing and this made the holiday much more enjoyable. \n\nThey never ask for tips but I do recommend you take some change and tip staff given the quality of service they give! \n\nI also liked the fact that although I was staying in the Aqua gardens I could use the restaurants and bars of other two adjacent resorts at no extra cost. You get similar food in all of them but it’s nice for a change of atmosphere. \n\nMy kids also loved the kids Disco as the animation team did a great job with the respect to entertaining the kids.",

      "text": "Stayed at the Charmillion Gardens Aqua Park Hotel with the family in October 2023. \nWe arrived relatively late on our check-in day and were Greeted by Mina at the reception. The main reception is situated in the Charmillion  Sealife Resort (which is literally opposite Charmillion Garden - about 50 steps away).\nMina was very helpful during the check and explained things thoroughly regarding our stay. We were offered a late dinner at 11pm due to our check in time. \nWe'd booked two family rooms, and were provided with exactly that. An added bonus was that they were connecting rooms which was perfect for our family. \nIt is obvious that the the resort is regularly well maintained. \nDuring our stay, ALL staff were incredibly helpful and there to support and aid wherever necessary. Some mentions (there were many more) to: Ahmed from housekeeping (in Block 44**) was superb and demonstrated kindness at all times. He showed real integrity as returning some valuable items that we'd left in the room once we'd checked out. \nMahmoud Farhat in the Garden Guest service went out of his way to help us. \nMavdi from the shop situated behind the Sealife Reception was very helpful in the mobile queries we had. \nMohammed Kamal and in the Lebanese restaurant did everything he could to make it a memorable experience for the children. \nHossam was fab from the Japanese restaurant. \nFinally, Ahmed Khairy was an absolute gem. He went above and beyond to ensure everything was ok. From helping to make a reservation in arabic, to adhering to any requests we had. He and the other staff would constantly check-in with us to ensure our stay was going as perfectly as we'd want.\n\nIn terms of the resort, we stayed at the Gardens. This had an awesome aqua park with around 9 thrilling slides. It also had a pool and a billiards table (chargeable). However, we were able to use either the gardens restaurant or the one opposite in the Sealife resort. \nFood was plentiful and full of variety. \nYou get 1 or 2 A la Carte resturant visits during your stay, depending on the length of your stay.We chose lebanese and japanese, both fabulous. \n\nThe beach is in the Sealife resort - about a 10 minute walk. \nThe Spa is situated on the 3rd hotel (Club Aqua), around 10 walk from Gardens. We were kindly assisted with a buggy due to the makeup of our group. \n\nThere is no wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby areas of sealife and gardens. However, you can buy a sim for around $10 with enough data to last a week. \n\nNaama bay - the main centre is about a 15 minute taxi ride away. I found it cheaper booking taxis through booking.com\n\nExcursions from the hotel are dearer then other local companies. \n\nThe last day we were able to have a later check out, this was massively helpful.\n\nOn the whole, we had an amazing experience. Thank you to all the staff. Our whole family loved the stay and we'd return again.",
