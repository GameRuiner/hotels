The beach staff will open an umbrella for you as the heat is mad, put them down if you want a dink just ask and food on the beach at a cost nothing is free I'm  surprised they don't bill everyone for breathing the air. \nRoom \nSmall, no balcony, just a lage window but comes with tec like you can put the TV on and go shower as they have speakers in there all controlled by the phone buttons even room cleaning. Do not enter, and so on. \nThe pool is long but not wide. I think there's 2 plus the man-made beach calm warm no waves obviously.\nWould I recommend this place? NO absolutely nothing around, so if you want something you gave to book a taxi 25 min drive yo Spinneys or another market plus the public can just rock up to the beach for a fee so sometimes it's busy and others not.

Price of the holiday was very reasonable through Travel supermarket. Food was good with 3 courses available which could be taken at either lunch time or dinner time. The kids menu was very good too. Lovely,  friendly and attentive staff. We enjoyed the beach club, the beach and the amazing views. £14 for a pint of Peroni. Expensive but not by Dubai standards. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",
