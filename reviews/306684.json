      "text": "The hotel in terms of fixtures and fittings is showing its age, and if you expect modern 5 star levels of luxury you will be disappointed. What it lacks in luxury is made up for though by some of the friendliest staff I have met in a hotel. We had the club access and were blown away by Florence and her team in the club lounge, where nothing was too much bother and always had a friendly smile. I would definitely recommend the club access which was well worth it for open alcoholic bar for 2 hours in an evening and a food spread that meant that you didn't need to buy food anywhere else. It really is like having half board. In terms of facilities, there is a pool outside, a free spa of sauna, steam room jacuzzi (all seen better days) and randomly an ice rink next door. Room was also tired and felt like I was stepping back in time to the 80s. Overall 3 star for the hotel and facilities, 5 star for the staff. Other shout outs to Roshini in club lounge, Faiq with the bags, and Farid cleaning the room.",

It was my birthday while we were there and they gave me a lovely cake at breakfast with candles and sang for me. It was so lovely! The area is in the older part of Dubai and you can easily walk to the Gold Souk and the Gold Souk metro station is even closer. The rooms are spotless and the bath is just huge! So relaxing after a long day of exploring. The restaurants in the hotel are also great! Can definitely recommend getting up to Helios for the sunset. Amazing views. Pool was great and always able to get fresh towels when needed. I would love to be back soon.",
