      "text": "After a few hiccups I can honestly say that I am very pleased to give this hotel 9/10 review. \nAt first I had doubts on arrival but as days went by these are my positive points. \nFirst and foremost if you have issues report to the following managers Mr Adel who looks after Rooms and housekeeping does a superb service making sure his staff clean the rooms perfectly. \nMr Harun - front office reception - super helpful and pleasant to deal with. \nMr Sayed - food and beverage manager very organised and happy to take criticism and fix problems. \nMohamed Emad - restaurant manager is always at hand to help. He has very good staff who he managers perfectly. \nThese guys get things sorted and can make your holiday most enjoyable. I missed dinner due to a late pick up from my excursion and manager done a complementary room service. Wow absolutely amazing. The selection of food was so delicious and large portions. Including desert. Very pleased. \nIf you ask you will be given a lovely holiday. \nEveryday the service is improving. \nPools - The is a large selection of swimming pools including a heated pool located closet to the restaurant. To get to the large selection of Water slides has a free taxi service running through out the day. It's very convenient. \nPool stuff are very helpful and don't even get tips. I did tip them because they made my pool experience very comfortable and relaxing. \nThe food is really good at the buffet with a large selection of everything. \nIf you ask the waiters to get you drinks they are very helpful rather than standing in a queue. Don't forget a tip goes a very long way. \nRooms\nAre kept clean and tidy. Very hard working staff again a small tip goes a long way. \nJohn at the little shop is a lovely friendly guy. His prices are decent and very good basic stuff to offer. \nNegatives \nI had a few but disappeared as so many things improved and changed my negative thoughts to positive. \nThere has to be at least one negative but I am sure the managers will change it. Bar near the disco area should be open at night so there is less queues at the main bar. \n\nDon't hesitate to book. It's a very nice hotel with lots of positives. I only wish I could talk to the mosquitos and tell them to stop bitting lol. \nWish you all a lovely holiday. \n",
