On the down side, the location is quite out of the way and a busy road crossing is required to reach the beach (that said, a shuttle bus transfer is availabe from the hotel to the beach). About 70% of the guests were from the CIS countries and the balance from northern Europe. Unfortunately, both my partner and I suffered repeated bouts of digestive upset which took the shine off the stay.",

      "text": "Just spent an amazing week at this lovely hotel with my friend. Im a travel agent so it takes alot to impress us. The hotel, food and the staff were perfect. Its in a quiet area about 10 mins walk from the beach but there is a regular bus the hotel provides if not wanting to walk. The beach is by the sister hotel which is being renovated  but you can still get All Inclusive drinks and did see them doing a BBQ but didnt use it. The hotels beach stretches a far bit so you can avoid building noise. Theres loads of luxury villas being build in the area so will be very elite.  Nice short tranfer from the airport. We did a couple of excursions with GetyourGuide and a guy recommended from Tripadvisor called Mustafa. Atvs sunset safari and White Island boat trip. Both excellent.  Taxi to Soho Square and Naama Bay was enjoyable. The weather all week was perfect. Definitely highly recommend this holiday.\n",

      "text": "Just returned from a brilliant holiday. Excellent hotel, great welcome, without exception the staff (particularly Shebi) can’t do enough for you and made sure we were always ok. Service is honestly second to none. Very clean, spotless rooms (no plug in the bath), air con great, plenty of pool towels and sun beds, quiet and shaded kids pool … everyone else preferred the main pool so we had it all to ourselves. Close to the airport so no lengthy transfers, and close to Soho Square. Would definitely stay there again. \n\nThe sister hotel is on the beach just down the road (free shuttle bus every 5 mins or so) but lots of construction work (we were there 13-20 March 2024) so you walk through a building site to reach it and it’s very noisy.  You can however walk a bit further down the beach to avoid the noise, so it's really not an issue, but the beach bar is back near the construction work. \n\nThe all inclusive main buffet restaurant was pretty good and the other a la carte restaurants were lovely - you are only supposed to be able to go to one of those once for free during your stay but we were allowed as many times as we liked.  The food  was delicious (especially the Mediterranean and Egyptian restaurants, and the Indian was pretty good too) but just one drawback - it’s not great for coeliacs as there are very very limited gluten free options, especially breads (thank goodness I took my own) and pastries and desserts (no gf options at all, so it was fruit or nothing), and it would have been far easier if all the food labels could include symbols or codes to show if vegetarian, vegan, gf etc as it wasn’t at all clear and most staff didn’t know. The bars and restaurants all had QR codes to scan for drink, cocktail, mocktail and food menus but you then order from the waiter.\n\nIf you go on trips, ask at reception for a takeaway food bag which they fill with filled rolls, pastries, a banana, bottle of water and a juice drink, vegetables and olives. Again not gf but if you ask they can prepare something different. \n\nAs I said in my review title, an excellent hotel!",

The spa was excellent and well worth the money spent. I had henna done on my hands, a facial and a full body massage during my stay and I must say it was fantastic. Adley and hamdey were also so lovely and make my visit wonderful always ensuring me and my child were served so quickly when ordering drinks. Also Mohamed from the beach bar. Despite there being a lot of work being done next to the beach (which was not actually mentioned prior to booking) we spent a lot of our time down there. Ahmad and Waled from the diving centre really did make my trip a great experience  as they helped with excursions for trip. There were so many people that made the trip memorable for me and my son and the hotel staff were so helpful overall. I would say this is a lovely resort for families however there wasn’t a lot of british people and alot of things are catered to Russians ect which isn’t a problem. A lot of the hotel guest were lovely however some were not so welcoming which if your a person of colour can be a quiet intimidating. However I guess this is a fault of the hotel and more so of the people residing within it.",
