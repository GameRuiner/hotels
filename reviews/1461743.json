When we went into the room the beds were sliding and in the bathroom the shower place did not have a door so when we got a shower water went everywhere and my mum slipped and fell. Our room was just next to reception and they made alot of noise all night and morning which made it difficult to sleep. Great location though.",

      "text": "We arrived Deniz House Hotel around 4 pm, we were informed that there is no vacancy at the Hotel however they offered us a room in what they called \"B Block\" This was a separate building which did not resemble a hotel and the room they showed us was in a basement, extremely small and dark. After protesting we were offered a room in the main hotel for which they wanted an additional payment of 20 Euros per night. \nIt was very amateurishly run. At the time of arrival they had workmen at the entrance and the floors were covered with gunge. In fairness that they cleared this up fairly quickly and apologised but it was not a good first impression.   \nAccording to the Deniz House Hotel reviews and they proudly advertise themselves as \"Afternoon Tea ; Even though it is known as English habit, Turks are also fond of afternoon tea offered with snacks. We keep the same tradition at Deniz Houses by offering complimentary tea, coffee, home made cakes and biscuits at our terrace in the early afternoon. You can watch the splendid view of the sea while you are having your tea at our terrace\". However there were no Turkish tea in the afternoon, no selection of cakes or biscuit, accept left over 'pogaca' which was stale and burnt. When we mentioned this to staff they were not interested at all.\nBreakfast suppose to be served 8 - 10 am and when we joined the breakfast just 9:10am, there were very little hot food left - four cold sausage and hardly any potato. We were not the last \npeople to arrive to the breakfast - there were at least four or five other parties who arrived after us.  \nBe aware that sea view rooms has railway line between the hotel however it was not noisy during our two night stay. \nWe would not stay in this hotel when we visit Istanbul again.\n\nMB",
