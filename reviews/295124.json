Shout-out to Eylem of the guest relations department who went way and beyond to assist me in finding the ID I lost at the airport and in making sure my stay was stress-free and amazing!\n\nAn incredibly wide array of delectable food and drinks were served in all the meal buffets. The live bands and cocktails I had in the evenings were a lot of fun, spa was incredibly clean and luxurious. My room had a breathtaking view (sunset especially) of the sea, pool and the majestic Taurus mountains as in wow!!! Definitely visit the stunning Konyaalti Beach which is only an escalator ride  away and the vibrant and historic Kaleici old town center. \n\nThank you, Rixos Downtown Antalya, for making my first visit to Antalya, a most memorable and marvelous holiday. I will definitely be back!",
