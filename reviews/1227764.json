      "text": "Upon arrival, we were greeted and given excellent customer service by the lady on the front desk named Tara who checked my partner and I in. Staff were pleasant and attentive at all times, with fluent English which was a plus. \n\nThe hotel was very modern and clean at all times, with house-keeping carrying out an excellent job daily. The two pools in the hotel have an accessible bar on the same floor which was great! Again, both pool areas were kept clean to great standard. \n\nAlthough the hotel is further out from the centre - there’s a metro stop just a 5 minute walk away (El Maresme) which takes you straight to the centre. Saying this, the area of the hotel still offers all local amenities such as a pharmacy, restaurants, supermarkets, bars etc. Due to this and the large shopping mall next door to the hotel with all types of shops and a food court - it serves well if you’re staying close to the hotel for the day. \n\nOverall the service and experience was 10/10 for my partner and I. We will definitely be returning in the near future!",

We had to sleep with the door open to the hallway and the door to the stairs propped open to get a little fresh air. This is 2024....it is time to have AC systems available all year. The front desk staff are beyond rude. Luckily, the housekeeping staff were kind, and the breakfast buffet was actually very good.

      "text": "I stayed at this hotel for a conference that was being held at the nearby convention center. I was disappointed from start to finish. The lobby was under construction to the point where it was disruptive to the entire hotel. There were no common seating areas, or places to interact with others. It was dusty and loud. This was the type of renovation for which the hotel should’ve been closed. They certainly should not have been listed as the top choice for a conference being held nearby.\nAs other reviewers have noted, they had no climate control working while we were there, and as the sun shone on the building, the rooms became extremely hot. You weren’t able to open the windows yourself and the management was so worried that people would leave a window open that they would, upon request, only open the window for a few minutes while you were out of the room.\nAlso, the shower water temperature regulation is erratic, causing you to actually scald yourself while taking a shower, because the temperature jumps around. Hair dryers are archaic—you have to hold the switch to keep it on. \nBreakfast was very nice, but that’s about all. \nI would not recommend.",
