      "text": "I strongly advise you to not go to this Hotel even though the price is affordable and the location is good. At first, I was given a room on the 1st floor, with extremely poor hygiene and cleanliness, not to mention the old dysfunctional furniture and poor-quality service. On the second night, I had to request them to change my room because the place was full of cockroaches (like dozens) at night and the shower was full of problems (cold water, low pressure). I was quickly given a new room on the 7th floor and it was a cleaner and better room. Staff are rarely well-trained, hard to access, and low in number. But I have to say that all of them are very nice and polite. The only exception was the night receptionist gentleman who is probably the most unfriendly person who ever existed in the hospitality industry, let alone any 4-star hotel! It is in fact a 2-star hotel, not a 4-star hotel and you should lower your expectations. There is no coordination between the reception and other parts, in particular the housekeeping, and it is impossible for the guest to contact the housekeeping directly from the room. You should be prepared to see your simple requests be systematically ignored. The gym was good and the breakfast and food were okay.\n",
