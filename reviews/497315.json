Very good well behaved staff. The lady at the restaurant served special low spicy food based on my request. AC inside the room well positioned and working perfect.",

      "text": "Date: December 18, 2023. I used the hotel in the 4 pm to 10 pm time slot. You get exactly what you pay for. The room was very clean and well equipped. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the shower didn't work well (possibly the shower head). Other than that, the staff was friendly and the location is great for walking around. There's tons of restaurants nearby and a really cool night market. Totally recommended if you have a few hours in Dubai and want/can get out of the airport. It's roughly a 10-min drive from the airport.",
