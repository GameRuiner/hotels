Rooftop area is really nice. \n\nBar garden nice spot to sit and relax. Location us pretty central. Walking distance to most places, outside of that, taxi or metro. \n\nAll in all 100% we would stay here again. We had a balcony front facing room. Suited us perfectly. ",

      "text": "The hotel was very easy to find from the airport bus drop off. The entrance/reception is stunning and smelt lovely. The reception staff were friendly and we were allowed to leave our bags until check in time. The room on the 5th floor was spacious and well equipped. The beds were very comfortable. Only couple of minor criticisms - despite setting the air con, it kicked in and was very cold meaning I had to turn it off which then meant the room was too warm. It could also have done with a hoover as could see bits of dust in the corners.",

      "text": "Arrived back home yesterday after a 4 night break in Barcelona  with my husband. The trip was for our 40th wedding anniversary and on booking didnt realise just how perfect this hotel would be for us . The location is ideal for exploring the city as a lot of the main attractions are within walking distance and if you want to use public transport there are bus stops and a metro station right outside the front door . The hotel is lovely inside and is well maintained with a bar which has a courtyard outside which is a very relaxing area to sit in and surprisingly quiet as the hotel is on a busy square , there is also a rooftop terrace with a plunge pool with sunloungers and another bar  .The restaurant is clean and bright and the breakfast is buffet style with plenty to choose from and friendly helpful staff . Our room was overlooking the square but had great soundproofing so traffic noise was not a problem and the facillities were spot on (large comfy bed , bathobe and slippers , coffee machine with complimentary pods and also a bootle of water per guest provided daily ) , even the toiletries provided are a quality brand could'nt fault it . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona .",

Bed was comfortable and there is a pillow menu if you have specific requirements. Temp control in room was best ever had in a hotel room.   Hotel itself is lovely, perfectly located for all Barcelonas sites and definitely one I would return to.  Wide choice of food for breakfast and each day slightly different.   Definitely would not disappoint for anyone wanting to explore this fabulous city.",
