      "text": "I was very scared reading all the previous reviews from the hotel .\nI emailed the reservation Center a few times before my arrival .\nI have to say that I had a marvellous staying in .\nI was there for 11 nights .\nThe housekeeping manager , a very gentil gentleman , greeted myself and my auntie on our arrival, shown us our two different bedrooms that he and his staff had prepared specially for us with a delicious and traditional fruit platter served in UAE .\nI had the same housekeeper cleaning my bedroom daily , it made all special!\nI didn‚Äôt have any issue with Air Conditioning or wi-fi at my room , on the opposite side . The AC was working perfectly fine .\nThe guys downstairs at the door were incredible friendly and on the top to help and assist with anything .\nThe receptionist ladies always friendly , professional and smiling. \n\nThe hotel has yes a very busy and well know club during the night time . YES !\nIf you arrive after 21:00 you will see guests coming to the club good looking women and men as it is ‚Äú dress to impress‚Äù!\n\nI was staying there with my auntie who is 69 years old and she kinda of liked to see many people around . \n\nI honestly had a fantastic experience!\nThank you very much for the hotel team .\nI will definitely get back to you.",

      "text": "Although it is a good price per night, when we arrive on the first day at the hotel, the reception inform us they they do not have any booking when we book trough hotels.com. They even inform us that we have been frauded and when we asked them about the website they inform us that it is fake and it is not theirs.(till today I still do not understand that they inform us that it is fake. If its true, they should report it)  To cut a long story short after 1hr waiting they found the booking trough Expedia.\n\nAs for Room, it is ok for those who are looking for a 3 star Hotel. One of the advantages it is a 5 mins walk trough a metro station",
