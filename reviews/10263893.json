      "text": "Clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff. They helped me a lot for finding the best way to go to everywhere. So close to internet city metro station( you can open the hotel backyard door with your own room card and go straight to metro station). Delicious breakfast. Clean pool. Free shuttles to JBR Beach, outlet mall and somewhere else. The only thing I didnt like was the mattress and the quality of the coverlet. I found it a bit uncomfortable. Thank you so much for your host.",

      "text": "We a group of six retirees from Brazil found the hotel to be conveniently located near Emirates Mall and Internet City Metro Station, with easy access to tourist attractions like Palm View and JBR Beach. The staff, including a sweet lady marra, were friendly, and the room service, as well as the assistance from concierge staff Zakir and Prem, was prompt and helpful. Twe will recommend the hotel to others and would consider booking it again in the future. \n\nTheir interaction with Muhammad, the travel desk agent, added an extra layer to our experience. After initially contacting the hotel for tour information, Muhammad provided excellent service, crafting a tailored plan for our short stay in Dubai. Upon meeting him in person, we found him to be respectful, honest, and knowledgeable. Throughout our three-day tour, Muhammad guided us to various locations, answered our questions, and ensured we had a memorable experience in Dubai. Best wishes to Muhammad from Rio.",
