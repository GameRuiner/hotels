      "text": "A budget hotel in the corner of Bur dubai.  Location was good but average as it slightly away from Meena Bazaar and other commercial establishments in Bur.  The problem is that these places were not at a very short walk but also not too far away for hiring a taxi.  The nearest station was Sharaf DG which is about a km away.  But all that said, there are a few eateries including vegetarian options nearby. Check-in process takes a long time.  The hotel is popular with Indian tour operators and many Indian tourists stay here and accordingly the buffet spread is also typically offers excellent Indian options-completely vegetarian option, however, there is a huge section for continental option also separately with a wide spread of non-veg options. Two mineral water bottles are provided daily. Toiletries offered are bare minimum. All tour operators pickup and drop off options from the hotel.  In non-peak season hotel offers, free airport pickup and drop and Desert Safari, with a minimum number of nights.  Overall the deal was OK for budget travellers",
