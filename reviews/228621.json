The restaurant was only for breakfast but there are many restaurants in the locale. Breakfast was good, combining cooked and continental, as much as you need. The hotel is in the business area but is well supplied with bars and a really large shopping centre with a lovely food court. The beach is just across the main road outside the hotel and is clean and well tended with a surf school for the more adventurous. The hotel is approximately a one hour walk from the sagrada familia along the main roads but a taxi is only 10-15 minutes and quite reasonably priced. Uber cabs are available as well.",
