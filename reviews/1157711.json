      "text": "This is the sister hotel to the more recently acquired Agora Konak Saray Hotel. First impressions on a very hot day in Izmir were unfavorable as the taxi driver negotiated tight turns, donkey carts, and local markets to reach the hotel on a crowded narrow street. The first night was unpleasant due to noise from outside. These concerns were shared with the hotel staff and immediately a change was made to a lovely room on the third floor. A spacious room with excellent AC, a desk for Internet writing, and close to the restaurant. The bathroom and general layout was fine for me as a solo traveler. The manager Nadir and staff Turgay and Kubilay were excellent after the first night's concern. English is spoken by several of the staff including Nadir and Turgay. The small reception area is balanced by the large, efficient, economical, and delicious restaurant on the third floor with chef Murat. I stayed several extra days due to the kindness and helpfulness of the staff. Side trips to Cesme and ferry stops in the bay of Izmir were lots of fun.",
