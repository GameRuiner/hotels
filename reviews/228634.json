You can hear everything outside and the room above you.\nBut the most unfair issue is that the hotel is under renovation and they didn't say that while I was booking a room through their website. I would expect to get a notice on the website and to decide if I want to stay in a hotel that doing constructions all day every day .\nWhen you want to take a rest in the middle of the day between your tours outside,it's unbearable!!\nAnd of course the room rate was the same.\nHotel management - if you know you are going to run constructions- at least you can do is to announce it before booing.\nAt least you can do is to offer a discount rate becau6of that\nYou did neither and it's unfair.\nI have 2 stars because the front desk was really nice.
