We were on the 1st floor so having a room on an upper floor you might not have heard the music and singing. Sleep wasn’t good because of this.",

      "text": "This hotel was fantastic value, situated just a couple of streets from La Ramblas and a few minutes walk from fantastic restaurants, yet surprisingly quiet at night.\n\nWe had an accessible room which was on the 1st floor, but it was right next to the lift (room 121). Great spacious bathroom with roll in shower. Spotlessly clean throughout, polite staff, fantastic breakfast all for £66 a night! Bargain!!!!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, there is an absolutely outstanding restaurant right opposite the front door. La Fonda. Highly recommend the salted cod fitters, duck  and the lamb shoulder!!  Would go again just to eat there! AMAZING! and didn't cost the earth.\n\nCannot recommend this place enough.\n\nIt was an hour from Barcelona airport. Buses were accessible with automatic ramps. Much cheaper than a taxi and took the same amount of time. One change which was literally walking to the other side of a roundabout. Hotel was a 10 minute walk from the seafront where the bus drops you off.\n\nWould recommend you downloading the 'citymapper' app. Very accurate and also has a 'step free' option for wheelchair users.",
