He allots the rooms to all waiting customers as per his whims and fancies without factoring in their age, long travel etc. So the first experience gets killed here after we waited at reception for more than 4hrs!!! And once room is allotted you are supposed to carry your own luggage to your rooms. Hotel overall is decent, did not take any of their services so can't comment. We stayed here for 6 days and breakfast was included in our package which was quite repetitive and average actually. Plenty of choices in the same rate available in same area so won't recommend",
