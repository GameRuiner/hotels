      "text": "Located right next to the Espanya metro line, this hotel is in a prime location. The Red L1, Green L3 & Pink L8 Lines will get you to/from here. There is also a taxi rank near the hotel and the airport bus picks up and stops at this location also. The N-340 road it is located on contains many convenience stores, eateries and the Hostafrancs Market. It is very close to Arenas de Barcelona (a shopping centre) and a lovely 10-minute stroll away from the Magic Fountain and the National Catalan Art Museum.\n\nThe hotel is environmentally conscious offering an incentive to guests who limit the number of times they get their room serviced. They also encourage you to take shorter showers and provided a Spotify code you could scan which took you to a playlist of songs lasting 4 minutes which I thought was cool. The room keys were made of wood rather than plastic and the takeaway coffee cups they provided at breakfast were recyclable and did not come with a plastic lid.\n\nWe stayed in a Superior room with breakfast included. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The hotel offers guests a pillow menu to ensure an enjoyable sleep. The storage space for folded clothes was quite limited with limited shelving but there were a good number of hangers provided for larger items of clothing. As a result of the limited storage in the room, there was no ironing board or iron but there was a clothes steamer provided which did the job perfectly well. The room had a safe, tea and coffee making facilities as well as a mini fridge with two bottles of water provided free of charge.\n\nThere are USB ports in the room to charge your things and good access to power sockets as well.\n\nBreakfast was served between 7 am and 10:30 am and offered hot and cold options designed to cater to anyone's palate. The scrambled eggs were tasty and the fresh pineapple was delicious. We found it a great way to start our day.\n\nThe reception staff spoke good English and helped with any questions we had. They were kind enough to hold our luggage for us when we checked out at noon and returned at 6 pm for our 9 pm flight at no cost.\n\nThe hotel has a swimming pool and bar on the top floor - access to which is gained through your room key. The swimming pool is quite small and narrow - not the kind of pool you would be doing lengths in. The rooftop bar was closed when we were there but it did offer beautiful views of Montjuic and the Barcelona skyline. Despite both areas being out of commission (probably because of the season) it is well worth a visit up there.\n\nIf I were coming back to Barcelona, I would definitely consider staying here again.",

      "text": "Good and modern hotel. Nice rooms with bathrooms, fridge and watercooker. Very quiet rooms. Small restaurant for breakfast and a nice bar. Also a bar on the roof. Swimming pool also on the roof, but that was out of order. You must use your card not only to get into your room but also to get there with the elevators. Safe feeling. Nice staff and helpful. Good breakfast. But don’t come late because the restaurant is than full and than you have to sit on high chairs.",
