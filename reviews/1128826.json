      "text": "We just came back from the Grand hotel, here is an honest review. \nWe checked in at 6:30 AM and the room was not ready for the visitors yet. We were traveling for 2 days and all we wanted at the point was to get some rest, by the time we checked in, it was impossible to breathe, the room was too dusty. However, during the breakfast time, we met one of the managers, who got taken care of that writhing 15 min. \n\nAfter that, our experience has turned the opposite direction. The staff did their best to make sure that our needs were met in all ways possible.  During our first night we were provided with all the important information and the guidance by Moussa, who got us aquatinted with  the hotel territory and the main distention points.\n\nWe would like to mention that the Lebanese restaurant was really underrated  in all the previous reviews that we read about before coming here. We expected nothing BUT it was a really pleasant surprise : Mohamed (the Doctor) has provided the best service ever. The atmosphere was outstanding, the place looked beautiful, the food was amazing. The approach was totally different from what we were used to in Egypt, but it felt like we didn‚Äôt tip him enough. \n\nYou should definitely get massage  at the resort. It‚Äôs an amazing relaxing experience for your body and soul. \nIf you are offered a Terran trip with dolphins üê¨, you should take it, it was one of the best experiences of our lives. \n\nOn Sundays you will be offered to attend the ‚ÄúOriental dinner‚Äù, where you will be enjoying the seafood and Tanura dancing, it is definitely worth going to and seeing \nThe  belly dancer was absolutely amazing.\n\nOverall: our experience for the Grand Hotel was great, one of the best hotels in Sharm. Personal attitude of the staff was amazing. Staff will make you feel special and will provide you with ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù experience by all the means. They find the personal approach  for every tourist. Even if you want something that they dont have at the hotel, they will make sure to find the way and opportunities to meet your needs.",

      "text": "This was our fourth visit to The Grand Hotel in Sharm ... the last being in September 2015 and we found that whilst the hotel itself was a little tired and under renovation in places , the staff and the service we received from everyone was absolutely first class. We would like to give particular mention to Samir who went above and beyond to make our stay as wonderful as possible and he was very well supported by all of his team members especially \"Mr Handsome \" who 60% of the time smells great every time (dont know what he's wearing :-)) Carlos , Bassim , Ahmed in the Lobby Bar and also Ahmed in the beach area . They \n We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough in terms of real value for money and welcome and we hope to return again later in the year.\nRuss, Donna and Isaac ( Mr Peperoni Pizza) Room 188",
