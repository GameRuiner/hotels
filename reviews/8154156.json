Although a bit dated, they’re clean and functional, with lots of space and free wifi. Staff are very friendly and responsive. Accessing restaurants etc in hotel is easy and very convenient. Outdoor pools are fantastic for children. Dedicated children’s water park is undergoing renovation but children’s pool still available. \nHighly recommend.",
