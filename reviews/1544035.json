The best about this hotel is it is next to the central bus station that will help you go to different places like ephesus, pamukkale and bergama. What i didnt like is they let us stay inside the lobby to wait for our room yo be vacant we arrive izmir at 0100 am and they didnt let us stay. There are no hotel near the vicinity so we waited and sleep at the bus station.",

To my surprise, when i have received my credit card statement, i was charged by the hotel (137TRY) for the booking made in which I have clearly stated in that reservation that my payment would be cash upon arrival.
