      "text": "I could say Haram to this Hotel.\nFirst we entered and they let us to wait,.\nWe were given the key card without any information at all. It's like \"take it and go\".\nWorst part the room.  I feel uncomfortable. Idont know if the things there were already used. Ceiling was  dripping in the toilet. Toilet seats are wet. Tissue not flushed well. Basin has goey thing. No toothbrush aswell. Towels were hanged like they dont care. No maintenance i could say. Worst part we are about to wake up and supposed to wash the kettle and the cup but to our shock the kettle was sooo diiirttty. Plus its rusty.. The blower was not attached to the plug which is undearneath the  table of the tv. It was so hard i even need to reach it myself... Cause the plug is in a small hole. Idont know its so frustrating..",

      "text": "I recently booked a room here and if I would be able to give 0/5 stars I would. \nMy first complaint is the poor customer service. As you walk in no one says hello, good morning or how are you. This is a hotel. You are hired to offer a service. But no one offers you any service of warmth. You feel awkward walking in and staff watching you instead of greeting you. \nMy second complaint is the lack of cleanliness for this place. Room service is so bad you might as well clean the room yourself. Below i’ve shown pics of garage not being moved- despite the service bell being on. Why am I paying for a dirty place.\nThird of all do not get me started on how our dated the rooms are. This place claims a 4 star, but doesn’t even match a 2 star standard. No\nsockets work to charge, the safe when mini fridge didn’t work either, I had to request for them\nto change it. Also, the walls are not nice. They are covered in weird black marks , you can see below in my pics. A place that is 4 stars is clean and modest but this place is not that.\nAlso, if you are allergic to tabacoo and cigarettes don’t stay here. Doesn’t matter if you are in a smoking room or not, the hall way will stink of smoke causing you to cough. \nAnd, the location is genuinely rubbish. It’s basically next to nothing and there is nothing good to eat nearby. \nHonestly save your money and do not fall for the description of this place. You will not feel welcomed or treated like you are a customer. Spend a little bit more money and time\nto research better options, but stay away from here. \nThank you",

Rooms are very cold , not clean , we check in for 5 nights And amenities such as shampoo shower gel or coffe tea was just upon arrival , housekeepers clean rooms as it’s punishment , towels are old and broken , all time just one towel in the room , no hand towel . We call every day for towel to bring second as we are two person . Sometimes they just ignore request and don’t bring it at all . \nDoors and furnitures are dirty and stained . \nThere’s no even hair dryer . \nI’m working in hotel industry as manager for years and I never experienced hotel like this . Definetly not 4 star . Avoid in all cost ! Not worth the price . I would give it 1 star .",
