Excellent customer service throughout our 5 night stay. Always acknowledged when arriving and leaving. Didn't use the hotel bus service but clearly helpful for guests. Parking was also provided for our friend when he came to pick us up. Had 3 breakfasts which were varied, good, something for everyone and exceeded expectations. Staff at breakfast were helpful and engaged with us. Nice walk to the Marina and Mall. Great first stay and hope to return soon.",
