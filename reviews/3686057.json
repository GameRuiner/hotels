      "text": "Bar staff and the majority of the hostel staff were great! Everyone seemed friendly enough, except for one male employee who lacked customer service skills and seemed like he wasnâ€™t interested in giving us the best stay possible. \nI know the hostel was busy, specially as it is the Easter Holidays, however the condescending and negative attitude made the majority of the group feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable. A situation occurred where this employee gave out free towels to half the group and refused to give towels to the other half - when this misunderstanding was brought up, he implied we were at fault and â€˜trying to stealâ€™. \n\nApart from this, the bar prices were great and location was very central around everything we needed such as metro, shops, supermarkets. Breakfast was included in our booking as we were a large group (20+), however timings between 7-8am were an issue and there was also limited options. \nRooms were spacious and clean, however the door/window was locked from around 6pm onwards until the late morning, so the room never got aired out, making it very hot to sleep in. There is also a light which doesnâ€™t turn off during the night. \n\nApart from the slight inconveniences, we all had a good time!",

        "text": "Hey Lily!\n\nThank you for sharing your feedback with us. We're glad to hear that you found our bar prices great and our location convenient. We apologize for any inconvenience. Regarding the towel situation, sometimes groups pre-book towels, which may lead to misunderstandings when they're distributed. Our colleague may have given them out initially assuming they were part of a pre-booked group, but we do have to charge for them if they're not included in the booking. We want to assure you that we never intended to imply that anyone was stealing. We were simply trying to clarify the situation and manage the allocation of resources fairly. We're sorry if this came across as confrontational. Regarding the timing of breakfast, we have a special time for bigger groups and it is in place to make sure everyone gets a chance to have it. We appreciate your feedback and will take it into account as we strive to improve our services. We're glad to hear that despite these inconveniences, you still had a good time overall. For any additional feedback please get in touch with your agency. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and provide you with a better experience.",

The pillow wasnâ€™t much better. Felt like the pillow was filled with old clothes/sheets.\n2. I was very undecided on breakfast, but caved and fell for the hard sell on breakfast. Then I realized I had to leave at 6:30 AM, because I had a 8:00 AM train to catch. However, breakfast didnâ€™t start until 8:00 AM. Staff refused to refund the breakfast fee paid,  even though I was never advised it was non-refundable.\n3. The other roommates were clashing and banging (packing) between MIDNIGHT and 2:00 AM.\n4. I was surrounded by snorers. \n5. Staff arenâ€™t interested in helping or assisting with tourist-related questions. \n6. Have decided my sleep, and peace of mind are worth more than saving a few dollars on hotels. I cannot, in all honesty, recommended St Christoperâ€™s Inn in Barcelona.",
