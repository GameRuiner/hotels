      "text": "We have visited this hotel twice. The first time in June 2022 and second time in October 2023. Both times we had an excellent stay. We had a sea view room which was lovely. Hotel is clean, staff are friendly and food & drinks are good. The hotel is only 10 minutes to Rhodes Old Town and the bus stop is just outside the hotel. There are some lovely bars & restaurants near to the hotel - we liked the sports bar - it had a great atmosphere and was really busy. Beach is just across the road, easy to access as a zebra crossing right outside hotel. Plenty of sunbeds / seating area for day & night. Entertainment most evenings. We definitely recommend this hotel, especially for the price.",

Restaurant got busy with queueing in the first hour of opening at dinner time. Food was varied with themed nights. Local drinks were average, wine was good, beer poor and cocktails were good. Entertainment was good with a selection of singers/dancers/performers. Across the road from the beach which has loungers free to use. You have to cross a busy road to get to the beach. Pools were freezing cold but good size with plenty of loungers. TUI rep Jason was very helpful. Overall a pleasant stay.",

Location excellent only 10 mins into Rhodes old town. The only improvements needed are around the pool . The grass that sunbeds are on gets very mucky at times so  a tiled surface would be much better. Small tables beside sun loungers would make it more comfortable so you could put food and drinks and personal items on them and not on the grass as ants where climbing into drinks when placed on ground. The sunbeds are very uncomfortable and need to be changed.",

      "text": "The hotel has a lovely friendly atmosphere and the staff are very helpful. Our room was changed from a garden view to a part sea view and unfortunately we had the extractor unit from the dining room right outside our balcony. This was noisy during meal times. There was a very loud noise coming from the kitchen below from 8am, it sounded like a loud industrial potato peeler. The maid service was very random as the towels we received each day was a bit of a lottery. They were also very noisy and did not pay enough attention to the servicing of the rooms as they were not kept as clean as I would have expected. \nThe dining room was well serviced and the food was very good. Enjoyed the different themes each night. The only improvement could be to have a drinks station at both ends. We were usually seated very quickly and only had to wait a few minutes. One of the best dining rooms we have experienced.\nThere are two pools; one large encircling a island with seating at the front of the building which was very cold and one smaller rectangular pool at the rear of the hotel that was warmer. We had no problem getting sunbeds at any time of day. Food at the pool was very good with a pizza, kebab, chips and salads at a hot station and cakes, fruit and filled rolls at a cold station. Some noise from the adjacent busy road could be heard. \nNightly entertainment was held outside and was quite enjoyable. When we were there there were a lot of smokers and it was difficult to avoid them. The bar inside had different music being played over speakers so it wasn't possible to enjoy the outside entertainment from inside to avoid the smokers. Smoking was not allowed indoors.\nThe hotel has free sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach across the road. There is no beach bar so food and drinks need to be collected from the pool area and taken across the busy road. I would recommend using swimming shoes to access the sea due to the pebbles. The sea was warm. There were water sports on the beach. \nWe walked into Rhodes town along the coastal path which was mostly flat. It took us about an hour. When the path passes below the cliff there are steps with a cross above. If you walk up those steps you will find a cave and shrine to St Michael the Archangel who is the patron saint of Rhodes. We visited this twice to light candles and remember close family we have lost. A lovely experience. \nWe did visit nearby bars and could recommend the FBI bar for a warm welcome, lovely drinks (we didn't have food but it looked delicious) and wall to wall TV screens. \nWe enjoyed our holiday and everyone we met in Ixia made us so welcome. \nThe pebbly beach and busy road will put us off returning and if we return to Rhodes we will try to find a quieter area with a sandy beach.\nThe hotel is classed as 4 star but it is not quite up to that standard more 3 star plus. \n \n",
