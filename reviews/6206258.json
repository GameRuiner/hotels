The standard of cleanliness in the hotel is excellent, check in was easy and pleasant, facilities are great.  The walls between the rooms however are paper thin take air plugs so you don't hear everything.  We also found the restaurant service non-existant however the food was OK.  There was an obvious difference in service  (or lack of) towards tourists, would not recommend eating there.",
