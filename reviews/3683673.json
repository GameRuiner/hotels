Francis from Dominican Republic was so plain, not kind and careless, he did not explain about the way the hostel works, the places you have right to, he was chatting on the phone all the time. I had a luggage bag, 2 backpacks and a little Ukulele he had me walking around the hostel without even offering any help. \nThe hostel was very basic, but quite dirty. I just stay one night and I’m glad I didn’t stay longer.",

We rented a 4-bed room for ourselves. Shared bathroom. Noise was tolerated by staff late into the night which was annoying and the bathrooms were not clean. Basic Breakfast Bat downstairs was a great deal at only €3 per person. ",
