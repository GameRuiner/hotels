The hotel was lovely, we couldn't fault anything,  rooms were spotless and staff were very friendly. On our last day the hotel was closing, so they put us up in there sister hotel for the day, they arranged for our luggage to be taken over and got in touch with our coach transfer to change our pick up location. This was very much appreciated.  Thanks again, hopefully we will be back sometime soon. \n\nCatherine and Stuart ",

      "text": "We enjoyed a lovely week at the Mitsis Palace in Rhodes Town. We chose to stay at this hotel because of itâ€™s super location - and we were not disappointed. It is a few minutes walk to the sea, a ten minute walk to the harbour, a fifteen minute walk to the Old Town. \nWe stayed in room 704, which had a lovely little balcony and a view. The room was very clean and spacious and it was well-appointed (I loved the Olivia toiletries in the bathroom). Tea and coffee making station and the fridge meant that we could be very self-sufficient.  The housekeeper on floor 7 was wonderful - helpful, efficient and friendly - a super lady.\nIndeed, all the staff were friendly and helpful, but a special mention to the lovely Vioya in the restaurant who had a smile on her face at 8am and 8pm! \nWe ate breakfast in the hotel every morning, and there was an excellent selection available every day - from fresh breads to made to order omelettes, Greek yoghurt and fresh honey to pancakes and syrup.\nDinner was self service buffet style, and there was a range of options; soups, salads, hot dishes, pizza, a selection of desserts -  not as nice as breakfast, but there was always something you could find to eat. \nThere was entertainment nightly in the bar area which seemed very popular. We could certainly hear it in our room, but it did always finish on the dot of 11, so it didnâ€™t spoil our sleep in our very comfortable beds! \nWe would definitely stay here again.",

      "text": "Put simply, I love this hotel. Iâ€™ve reviewed it before and so wonâ€™t go into great detail (this was our sixth visit over thirteen years). If you are looking for a friendly hotel in a great location, the Petit Palais is superbly positioned. The beach is a two minute walk away and the medieval city can be reached in about ten minutes. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, bars and shops. I like being in the â€˜thick of itâ€™ whilst staying in a relatively small hotel. Due to its size, you really do feel like part of the family. The pool area is small, but perfectly formed, with a great bar area and Alex makes the best mojitos and iced coffees. Youâ€™ll have stayed in bigger, flashier hotels, but this has something real and unique which will grab you. Wherever, I travel to in this big world of ours, the Petit Palais holds a special place in my heart. The staff are wonderful, particularly Margarita, Zara, Alex, Dimi and a big shout out to Dimitris who made a great dance partner at the Halloween party!",
