No laundry service but there is a self-service laundry centre within walking distance. Also located very close to a metro/train station so can be anywhere in the city quite quickly.  Hotel located beside a small shopping area with a grocery store and a number of restaurants. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. My only comment: if you have scent-sensitivities, wear a mask in the lobby as there can be strong scents at times.",

      "text": "This hotel was on the cheaper end for Barcelona -- which doesn't mean cheap, just less expensive in a very expensive city. For the room rate of around £169/night when we stayed, it was underwhelming. The bedsheet had an obvious tear in it but was used anyway. The desk in the room had splatters on it from a previous guest. The shower had long hairs in it from a previous guest. No facial tissues in the room. Many satellite TV channels not available on the very small monitor. \n\nOn the plus side, the front desk staff were always friendly and attentive and quickly responsive. There is a dining area in the lobby when one can work, have a coffee or a beer. There is a shopping mall next door with numerous shopping and dining options. Although it's not in the centre of the city, there are several Metro stations within about a 10-minute walk and the major attractions are 30 to 40 minutes away.\n\nAs other reviewers mentioned, the room key would also sometimes stop working. This happened to me twice, causing me each time to go back down from the 10th floor to Reception to have the key reactivated. This was frustrating, especially after a busy day when I was ready to shower and relax.\n\nOverall I felt things were done on the cheap here, and for the price they could have afforded to do a bit better. But the service is good and the front-desk staff deserve compliments. I probably would not stay here again if other similar priced options are available. I would probably pay £20 to £30 more per night to stay somewhere nicer if that was the difference. They could do better. ",
