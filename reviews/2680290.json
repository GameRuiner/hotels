Nice daily and night activities and a brilliant in Heart of Kundu in general. \n\nJust want to mention one negative point which is the SPA reception member, a man with almost no hair and black t shirt which we met on 09.04.24 around 15:30 at spa reception, when we asked for shampoo for Turkish Hamam the answer was we don't have shampoo for Turkish Hamam and you can not wash yourselves at Turkish Hamam ! I did not detect any try by him to help the guest, if this is a logical action for this hotel, I have nothing to say more",
