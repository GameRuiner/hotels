      "text": "Having stayed in Dubai several times, I have to say this hotel falls short in certain aspects.\nThe pool is located on a terrace between the two hotel buildings and is mainly on the shade throughout the day. This also means the sun loungers around the edge of the pool are often in the shade too.\nThere is a large terrace which also has loungers but again we often found that wherever you sat there was a fair bit of shade through the day. \nAs there are two hotel buildings and the terrace is in between, this creates a wonderful tunnel which isn’t the most pleasant environment in which to sunbathe.\nAside from this, the food was great and varied each day and on the whole, the staff were very helpful.\nTip for travellers: download the Careem app for taxi bookings. We did and it was super easy!",
