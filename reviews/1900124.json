      "text": "Unfortunately I don’t recommend the hotel. We were off sick with food poisoning and had to take our daughter to the hospital. The other guests were being sick outside of the restaurant. The smell of the drainage was disgusting. Basically no cleaning, very poor hygiene. We requested a room upgrade as the first one was absolutely shocking, with a stained bath. Avoid the hotel, especially with children. It’s a shame as the location and beach were very good. ",

      "text": "I stayed at the PEGASOS in late October and wish that I didn't. An honest review, here goes:\n-A sickness bug was in the hotel, guests and staff were aware but did nothing about it, seeing other guests being sick in communal areas was a regular occurrence. Poor hygiene practices in place, luke warm food-awful. I was sick for a couple of days. Customers wearing disposable gloves when using the serving spoons at the hot plate. \n-Having to pay for bottled water (even when you're dehydrated from D&V) They only serve water in re-usable dirty plastic cups-they are gross. Watching the staff drinking from bottled water. \n-Communal toilets-dirty. Food being left on the stairwell for 48 hours. \n-Having to pay 2 euros for orange juice-per person. \n-The Gym-dirty kit and broken, runner, rower bike all unserviceable.\n-Rude staff, main bar and the manger at reception-she clearly thinks that all of these examples above are acceptable. \n-Entertainment team in the evening was terrible. The daytime activities were ok.\n\nUnfortunately I was moved from the Dama Dama about 3 weeks before travelling and called easyJet to move hotels-unhelpful. I should have gone with my \"Gut feeling\" after reading other poor reviews and cancelled the holiday, unfortunately I took a chance and came back  3kg lighter in weight. I think that this poor experience could be put down to the end of the season but this is a poor hotel that needs a good shake up-and deep clean. Don't take the chance. \n\n",

I know I was there in October but it still should have retained heat. 2) The bathrooms in the rooms aren't up to scratch. A bath with a screen which was awkward to get into because if the proximity of the sink. Ripping them out ans putting in large shower cubicles would make far more sense. Apart from that Id recommend it to anyone",

      "text": "Location - quick 20min airport transfer on arrival. Only a few bars & shops nearby (as we arrived near end of season these all closed by 1st Nov). Very busy main road outside with vehicles driving fast, so quite dangerous to cross & traffic noise kept waking us up during the night. We took bus into Rhodes town (they run approx every 20mins but get very busy around 5pm €2.5 per person one way) - good selection of shops (incl.Sephora, Stradivarius, Pull&Bear & Pandora) & bars/cafes.\nWithin the hotel there are 2 shops - 1 selling jewellery, the other selling some clothing/bags/toiletries/beach stuff & souvenirs & there is a spa on the lower ground floor.\nRoom - We had room on side, but still with sea view. Room itself was ok - air con included & fridge with large bottle of water on arrival. Had to pay for safe key (€18 for 1wk). Wardrobe only had 5 hangers each for 2 people. Couldn't hang maxi dresses in it as there was a shelf in the way below. The bath & shower in our 4th floor room needs updating as shower was very weak & it was quite cramped standing in bath to use it. They have liquid soap dispensers for shower & basin, but no other toiletries/tissues provided. Hairdryer & shaver point in bathroom. Towels were all changed daily & cleaners kept rooms nice & clean.\nFood-Main buffet restaurant had hot & cold choices - enough for most fussy eaters, but was a bit repetitive even within one week. 'Fresh juice' dispensers tasted more like watered down cordial (they were charging €2 for freshly squeezed orange juice!). There were fizzy drinks & water options too. Coffee available at all meals but tea for breakfast only. \nA la carte restaurant closed from 1st Nov so we missed chance to try it. \nNear pool the choc crepes/waffles really good, also has pizzas, gyros, chips & noodles options. Pool bar service really good. Indoor bar staff not so attentive & we found the woman serving was quite grumpy & carried on chatting to the barman instead of serving us. All restaurant staff were lovely especially Babis & Lysta.\nPool- really clean main pool & surrounding area, but the pool water was absolutely freezing & too deep - I could only touch the bottom in a quarter of it. As it was end of season there were always loads of empty sunbeds round the pool & on the beach. Towels can be picked up from the spa & can be changed every 2 days. \nEntertainment - during the day there was aqua gym, darts, water polo, french boules & beach volleyball plus 3 pool tables indoors (have to pay €6 at reception to get the box of balls for pool but can stay on as long you want within reason). Animation team (Gustavo, Andre & Evelyn) worked hard to try & get guests involved (not easy when there were fewer guests). We felt kids disco was on far too late at 9-10.30pm (other resorts we've been to do 7.30 -8.30), so we couldn't be bothered to wait around for the evening entertainment (quiz, karoake & Greek dancing).\nOverall we felt a week was enough here.",
