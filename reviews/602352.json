      "text": "We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of March as a family of 4. We had a family room booked but they kindly upgraded us at checkin as it was for my 50th birthday celebration, which was really nice! Amazing room, we had 3 bedrooms and loads of space, everything you need to self cater for a few days. Spotlessly clean with some decent views through the hotels opposite to the sea. Staff were friendly and helpful, cant fault them. Handily has a supermarket on the ground floor which was a godsend for essentials, although plenty of water was provided for us. \nLocation was great for getting cabs along to the palm, although it was a little further out for visiting the Burj Al Khalifa area (thankfully cabs are cheap but its about 35 mins drive). Lots of restaurants along the road outside the hotel, and also the beach is a 5 minute walk across the road by the Hilton Hotel.\nThe only niggle I had was the breakfast. The food wasn't as good or as plentiful as I thought it would be, and they only had one coffee machine for all of the people that were staying there. I gave up queuing due to the wait time. They need at least one more machine, or have a table service offering this and have staff making them. \nOther than this slight niggle, was really happy with this place and would definitely stay here again.",
