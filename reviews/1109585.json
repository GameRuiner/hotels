      "text": "Excellent family resort. Don’t read the other reviews, yes the rooms could be better but like us if you are reading this you probably can’t afford the four seasons for a cheeky week away. Also plenty of food. Great location best of both, sea, sand and pools. A pier for snorkelling too! There is also a water park … great amenities , Wi-Fi throughout. 3 Al-carte restaurants… camels on the beach, sun beds plentiful… entertainment actually entertaining ….. in all a great family holiday! Staff and locals are so friendly and welcoming! Venture out as could not believe how cheap everything is!! We will be back…",

All the facilities are really good the only area I would want improving would be the food as it can be quite repetitive and lacks diversity.\nIf they sort the food we would definitely come back, Thank you for an amazing holiday Sea Beach just sort that food so that we can come back.",

      "text": "Booked this holiday as a last minute trip, so went with average expectations. We arrived late at night, and had a quick friendly check in, and were advised although the restaurant was closed that snacks were available at the beach bar which was helpful. \n\nOur room was a 2 bedroom family room, both good sizes one with a large King size bed and the other 2 singles. Rooms and bathrooms were super clean and well kept. The cleaner of our block greeted us the next morning and asked if there was anything we needed to let him know, he was fantastic all week keeping us well stocked with water in our room, kept the rooms looking great, was always friendly and chatty, a really fantastic service.\n\nThere was a smaller quieter (warmer) pool between the room blocks which we tended to do on a morning. Again the safe life guard here each day, was fantastic and friendly with all the kids. There was no early mad rush for sun loungers, and on the odd occasion it was a bit busier the life guards were always quick to find you some spare loungers.\n\nAqua park was fantastic, around 14 different slides, and then a large smaller kids pool, slides, and play areas. It was very hot and only limited parasols for shaded areas, so we tended to do a couple of hours and then go back to the pool areas. Again plenty of space and never had a problem finding an area to relax.\n\nMain pool is huge with swim up bar, again plenty of space around the pool, this one is much colder but in the high heat was always very welcome.\n\nBeach area was great for relaxing at hottest part of the day as loads of space and plenty of shaded areas for the littler ones. Beach is quite a course sand so not bucket and spade but was still a fantastic area to chill out and the waiters from the beach bar were fantastic at looking after you. The sea is super shallow so great for kids to wander around in but is quite rocky so take beach shoes. Also a jetty that is half a mile long which is great for seeing various ocean life, and goes to a great area for scuba enthusiasts.\n\nFood - there was two main restaurants, which were standard all inclusive food, always plenty of choice so never had trouble finding anything, but fairly standard. They do get quite busy so we tended to go earlyish and never had a problem. There are 2 snack bars through the day one near the beach and one near the aqua park, both cook fresh pizza in a huge pizza oven throughout the day and the usually chicken nuggets or hot dogs. There are 2 a la carters your can book Italian and Indian, we opted for the Indian, starters were a little average (soup) but the main curry’s were really good quality.\n\nBars - a few scattered around we tended to use the main terrace bar early evening and then move to the beach bar for entertainment later. Again the bar staff at the terrace bar were fantastic, super friendly and chatty, the kids loved order mocktails and their banter. \n\nAnimation Team - We are not usually too bothered about evening  entertainment, but the animation team were fantastic, not in a pushy way but having fun with us and messing around with the kids, every night our kids insisted on going to the mini disco to see what tricks they would get up to.\n\nShops - there are shops in the main building of the hotel, one general shop selling souvenirs, snacks etc… one selling bags, and one for clothes / football kits. The football kit shop our 9 year old loved, the guy working there was fantastic, really friendly and helpful and not at all pushy, our son loved going in and having a chat with him, he was probably the highlight of our sons holiday.\n\nWiFi we were worried about as read different things. There is free WiFi throughout the hotel. The speed is very hit and miss, if you want to just be able to check email, messages etc… totally fine, but not fast enough to stream anything. There are cheap SIM cards available at the hotel, we had 1 cheap eSIM for bigger data needs, but the WiFi was sufficient for 90% of the time.\n\nFor tipping we got some Egyptian pounds from the airport cash machine, in the hotel they were happy with any currency or also had card machines.\n\nOverall, we would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again. Everything was super clean and every member of staff super friendly, without ever being pushy. \n\nSpecial shout outs to the bar staff at the terrace bar, our cleaner at block 31, the fantastic animation team and the friendly football kit man.",
