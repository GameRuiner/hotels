      "text": "Beware; this hotel is not like what it advertises itself as on their website. \n\nUpon arrival, the hotel is outdated and rooms are in a desperate need of updating and cleaning. The furniture in the rooms look like they’re 20+ years old, the drapery was all damaged, sockets and lights falling off the walls. The bathrooms again, very outdated. On their website, you see pictures of modern bathroom with walk-in showers etc. That was not the case on our visit. Perhaps some do the rooms/floors have been renovated to this standard.\n\nWe were upgraded to a ‘Burj View’ room which was the only redeeming feature of the hotel. The balcony was large enough you could see the entirety of Sheikh Zayed Road - from the Museum of the Future to the the Burj. Back inside the room however, was a complete eye sore. \n\nBreakfast was included with our room. However, after the first day, we avoided it like the plague and would advise to head out for breakfast as there is an abundance of great alternatives outside the hotel.\nThe breakfast room itself was small and ran from 7am - 10am. However, little selection of food and the omelette station needed some discipline. There was a lack of juices/tea/coffee aswell as cutlery and even staff. \nYou’ll spend most of your time queuing up for something only to find other people pushing in and then heading back to your table, you’ll find someone has taken your spot - even if you have left your belongings there. \n\nAll in all, the location of the hotel is the only highlight with it being only a couple minutes walk to the Metro or a 25 minute walk to the Burj if up for it. \nIt doesn’t meet the standards of a 4*, a 2* at best. Avoid and opt for an alternative in the same location.",

      "text": "The hotel entices guests with enticing room photographs, but upon arrival, the actual accommodations bear little resemblance to the advertised images. The rooms are poorly maintained, with discolored white linens and towels, and some rooms even suffer from water leaks. We were forced to switch rooms three times in a single day in order to find one that was tolerable. It is strongly advised to steer clear of this hotel during your visit to Dubai, as it ranks among the worst accommodations I have encountered in all my years of travel.\nAny positive review you find about them are planted.",

      "text": "We arrived on 3d Feb for 1 night. We did check in at around 1:00 am, and I had indicated the approximate time of arrival in the reservation. The receptionist was working very slowly. When we were given the keys to the room on the 23rd floor, we were excited to go in. The balcony had a view of the Burj Khalifa, but the balcony doors/windows themselves didn't open. We tried to open the balcony door in the morning, but found that it was blocked by some screws which the staff had randomly inserted into the balcony frame to prevent it from opening. Then in the morning, we realized that there was a mini kitchen, but there were no plates or teaspoons, only packets of instant coffee, tea, and sugar without any cutlery. We didn't know how to stir the sugar in the mug... PLUS, in the morning when the room cleaning staff came to our floor, everything was very noisy and we could hear what was happening outside in the corridor, even though we had a \"do not disturb\" sign hanging on our door. Nobody entered our room, but we could hear everything happening outside while we were inside the room. By the way, the balcony that never opened - it seemed to have soundproof windows, but since the room faces Sheikh Zayed Road, the main highway, we could hear the noise of cars. One positive thing to note is that they were accommodating to our request, although not on the first attempt but on the second one - regarding the late check-out. They allowed us to check out at 3:00 PM as we explained that our flight was around 6:00 PM and we would appreciate being able to check out at 3:00 PM instead of 1:00 PM... They approved this request on the second try. Overall, our experience at the hotel was quite disappointing. The slow check-in process, balcony door issue, lack of basic kitchen utensils, and the noise from the corridor and highway made our stay less enjoyable. We had hoped for a better experience considering the hotel's location and reputation.",
