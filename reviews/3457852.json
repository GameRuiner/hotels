As one would expect in a hostel, the towels are thin, the guests are noisy, the toilet paper needs constant replenishing, etc.  We selected the Bird House for its location (El Raval is great) and because we thought a bunk-bed room for the four of us would be fun and novel.

We are NOT expected room as different shown from website. I feel like weâ€™re in the big brother because one of camera is watching us, following us wherever we go in the kitchen. A manager is spying on us. Next day, we go downstairs and saw a reception and a guy who staring me, like killing me into his eyes! He approached me and showed me a photo of air conditioning remote battery is missing. I told him itâ€™s not my fault. My daughter did NOT know anything and she played with this remote. Then I realise how did a manager enter my room?!?! This is so wrong. I realise this hotel is unsafe. Please do not bring your kids to that hotel!! I would say 0 out of 10!! Terrible service, terrible customers and we donâ€™t feel welcome here. \n\nAlso my roommate is complaining when my daughter criesðŸ˜‚when sheâ€™s having a child she will understand! I couldnâ€™t give a damn, the important thing is sheâ€™s wanting a milk. Sorry guys! \n\nTrust me guys, do not go there I feel scared and being watched.",
