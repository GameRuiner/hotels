The rooms were spacious and immaculately cleaned by Ramu\nand Ambar to an exceptional standard. Coming back to our super clean room every day was refreshing. They work incredibly hard and made an extra effort always and to put the children’s soft toys on the beds. Staff throughout the hotel and at breakfast were all so happy, cheerful and accommodating to your every needs. The gentleman at the coffee station was always happy and welcoming and made sure our coffees were brought to our table at record speed with a smile.  We have loved our time here immensely and would totally recommend to anyone. The location is perfect and the tram and monorail close by. The staff at concierge are amazing and very helpful and polite. Always asking how we are. The good on offer at breakfast is exceptional. So much choice!",

Frederick, whom I've booked  with over the past few years, is an outstanding organizer and host. Even with a last-minute booking on the final day, he ensured we received a good table location. I would like to give special recognition to “Amal”, a dedicated and pleasant server, who attended to our needs diligently and frequently checked in to see if we required anything else. Lastly, Anjalica made certain that we concluded our evening on a high note while she prepared the bill. \nA heartfelt commendation to both Frederick and Amal for their exceptional service‼️",
