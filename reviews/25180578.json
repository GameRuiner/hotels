The food was delicious, very tasty (but sometimes a little bit spicy)\nThe location is good, there is a bus station near the hotel, so we could easy go to Abu Dhabi and to the beach. The metro station is in 2 min walk from the hotel - it’s very comfy!\nMany thanks Anuj Rohit Yadav for help with getting Burj Khalifa and desert safari tickets!!)\nTo sum up, we were enjoyed staying at this hotel, so I actually recommend you Wescott Hotel!",
