Upon realizing my mistake, I contacted the hotel, and the head of security, who was exceptionally courteous and professional, promptly confirmed that my money had been found. After verifying my identity, they graciously arranged for a trusted friend to collect the funds on my behalf. I am immensely grateful for their honesty, integrity, and outstanding service. This experience truly exemplifies the exceptional standards of the Dubai Ibis hotel, and I cannot thank them enough for their kindness and reliability.‚Äù",
