Here is the review.\n\nLocation: The hotel is located a short 2 minutes walk from the beach. Its close to the casino & many cafes, restaurants, shops & bars are only a few minutes walk away. Very central. The hotel is central to all that Rhodes town has to offer.\n\nStaff: The staff are very friendly & efficient at their jobs. We were checked in by Irene & she is so warm & welcoming after a long night flight. All cleaning staff we met were also very friendly & helpful.\n\nRooms: This is a very new hotel. The entire hotel is very clean & smells very fresh.\nOur room was on the first floor with a partial sea view. The bed was comfortable & there was a choice of two pillows.\nThe bathroom was adequate too but there seemed to be an issue with the seal in the shower & unless you were very careful the water leaked out onto the floor.\n\nRoom Facilities: Plenty of cupboard space for clothing. A fridge & safe. Lighting was good too. Coffee maker and small tabletop stove supplied.\n\nNegatives: As stated the shower was leaking at the bottom tray when in use.\n\nOne one occasion there was no toilet roll replenished.\n\nThere was a lack of cutlery ie a good bread knife etc\n\nIf your a light sleeper do not book a room at the front of the hotel. The hotel faces onto a busy road & is above a busy restaurant. We were here out of season October on the 1st floor & even then for the first 3-4 nights we slept very little. Scooters, chairs being moved, buses etc make a lot of noise.\n\nAll in all this is a great hotel but it needs to invest in some good soundproofing on the windows for the front facing rooms.\n\nI would still highly recommend it for a stay in Rhodes, it represents great value & just bring some earplugs if your a light sleeper.\n\n",
