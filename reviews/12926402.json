From impeccable customer service to outstanding facilities, including spacious rooms, well-equipped gym, and inviting swimming pool, everything is flawless. The convenient connection to the mall and proximity to the airport add to its allure. However, the only minor issue I encountered was the water pressure in the bathroom. Nevertheless, the exceptional quality of service has remained consistent throughout my 10 stays. Highly recommended.",

The beds are an absolute plus , they are very comfortable (with simmons beautyrest matresses) . The housekeeping was every day . The food was  ok to very good with mostly changing middle eastern recipes , but also some european choices. I always found something to eat in the buffet . IThe personal in the hotel is an absolute plus: EVERYBODY was very welcoming and friendly.  If i come back to dubai , i will absolutly stay again in this place. The price/value ratio is  very good.",
