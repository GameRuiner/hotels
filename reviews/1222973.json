However my major complaint is with front desk Naseem the most pathetic person in hotel industry . \nI have booked the apartment over 2 months. Being a migraine patient sometimes I need my food delivery at the room. The hotel police told me by nadeem was no delivery at room. In 2months daily I eat from out most time we get down and collect it. However when I'm not well I request to be sent and this has happened 3 to 4 times in a month. Today afternoon I request Naseem send the food to my room \" no we do not provide it at tge room take it from desk. I asked I'm not well pls send or I will ask manager. He said \"talk to the Manger i will not send and just hung up. In my 16 yrs of travel no one has behaved this way . Room are ok ,wifi littel bad , but most pathetic is nadeem ruthlessly hung up and for more than 1.5 hours I waited for my lunch at the room.  I called again and asked to send it another person said ok and after 1.t hours I got my food cold . NADEEM LEARN SOME MANNERS . \n\nROOM 612 .",
