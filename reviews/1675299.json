We chose this hotel as our flights were at abnormal times so this hotel offered a shuttle bus from the airport and 24hour check in. The room was a good size. Fridge and kettle was available in the room. The beds were clean and very comfortable. Bathroom was a good size. Rooms were basic decor but neat and tidy. The hotel currently has works going on but only during the hours o 9-5, it only affected us when we went for a sleep during he day. The breakfast was included and offered a big selection. The staff were very friendly. There is a grocers next door for supplies if needed. The hotel is less than a 10 min walk to the metro station.",
