      "text": "We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel! We have booked a suite (2 adults and 2 children). The room was very comfortable, it was great to have 2 showers and a bath for the little one. The swimming pool for children was a pleasure. It is 40 cm depth and has a wooden pergola, so children don’t get burn at the sun. The water is very warm there. We have stayed at the beach most of the time and really enjoyed the service there. Great thanks to Ashan, Silvey and Abhishek! They made our stay very comfortable and pleasant! Thank you, guys! We will definitely be back:)",

      "text": "We booked this hotel following a recommendation from a friend and relative for the area itself. The hotel staff from day one were amazing, a warm cookie provided upon arrival went down well with the kids after a long journey ! We travelled as a family of 5 MIL, 14 year old, 12 year old myself and partner. We wanted to stay in a living space together with separate bedrooms. This hotel provided exactly that. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment with sea view. The rooms were very spacious, pressure in the showers was perfect, beds and pillows were incredibly comfortable. The connected living space, kitchen and  dining area was enormous with incredible views of the wheel, beach , sea and swimming pool. Standard tea and coffee making facilities replenished daily, bottled water also provided daily. \nWe were spoilt for choice with breakfast, huge variety to choose from depending on what you want. Great facilities and seating both inside and outside. The hotel itself was  clean throughout.\nSwimming pool and swim up bar    Service excellent , again staff were accommodating , friendly and always available. Swimming pool was warm and a hit for both adults and children on the cloudy days of our stay. \nBeach is clean and easy to get to from the hotel. \nWe only had breakfast included  as part of our stay.  A variety of restaurants to suit individual budgets can be found within walking distance. \nWe travelled out to see various sights using Uber from outside the hotel or inside the lobby straightforward and easy. \nIf travelling on foot, plenty of areas to explore and beachfront walk was lovely every morning after breakfast. \nWifi connection could be better in the apartment living space we seemed to have an intermittent connection there, however, signal strong in bedrooms and throughout hotel. \nOverall an excellent stay , impeccable service from the hotel staff, would certainly recommend for families.",
