      "text": "Apartment was incredibly dirty, dusty, kitchen sticky, furnitures should be replaced long time ago. Kitchen not really equipped. Housekeeping staff didn't replaced all towels, didn't give toilet paper. \nAll noises from the road, no difference with shut balcony door.\nAfter staying there I read a couple of reviews and I realised that only reason why this hotel has got such a good reviews is because staff was requesting that and mentioning their name too..pathetic.\nApart from bad condition of apartment (which of course shouldn't happend in this type of hotel), the worst was how we were treated. \nI was astounded, never seen that before. I was staying with my parents, so 3 people. We got two towels, I had to request 3 times about getting extra one. I was told ' someone will bring it' every time, but never happend till I walked down to reception and asked in person. The same happend next day. Also at reception had to request about toilet paper which was missing. I've never got any glasses (there was just one in the kitchen), and another cup (2 in the kitchen) through our 3 nights staying. We used Costa cups for our morning coffee...Talking to housekeeping staff was like talking to the air. ",

      "text": "I had visited Dubai for business and leisure purpose. I chose to stay at Mercure Suites and this is one of the best experiences I will never forget except for the experience with front office lady\n\nThe room was facing Sheikh Zayed Road, skyline, sea, Burj al arab, Al Ain and partly Pam jumeirah. Really amazing view!\n\nFirst, let me praise the wonderful aspects of this hotel. The rooms, amenities, food, and location are all superb. They have a large size swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam bath. The hotel has a unique charm and elegance that makes it stand out from the rest. But what really impressed me the most was the hospitality and service of the staff members. They were all friendly, helpful, and professional, and they went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. I made a point of asking for their names, so I can acknowledge them here and express my gratitude. They are:\n\n- Christine, from Day and Light, who was always cheerful and attentive, and made me feel welcome every morning. She had a great hospitality. \n\n- Azhar and Amman, from the reception, who were courteous and efficient, and handled my requests and inquiries with ease. They were very flexible and accommodating, and they made sure that I got the room and the extra bed that I wanted as it was already confirmed by Omar a month before my checkin date.\n\n- Masur and Parvathi, from the housekeeping, who kept my room spotless and cozy, and provided me with everything I needed. They were very respectful and discreet, and they always greeted me with a smile. They came immediately for assisting me when I called the housekeeping desk.\n\n- Muhammed, Hosseini, and Abdullah, from Codelight, who had amazing hospitality and they made me feel as if I know them from a long time.\n\n- Mahesh, from the swimming pool, who was friendly and helpful. He was very attentive and caring, and he offered me towels. He got ready the steam bath and sauna rooms when I needed them.\n\n- Omar, from the reservations, who was responsive and flexible, and arranged my booking and confirmation smoothly. He was very understanding and generous, and he offered me a free extra bed for the entire stay as a compensation.\n\nThe only negative and the worst experience  I had - \n\nThe front office lady (supervisor) was rude by arguing about the extra bed though it was clearly mentioned in the terms and conditions of the itinerary. I had told I have an important meeting and even showed the email where it says the extra bed is included but still she kept arguing and I had to postpone my meeting",
