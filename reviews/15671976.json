The health spa is ok but the main man is very persuasive and make sure you bargain hard for the treatments and massages. Best I heard was ¬£35 each for 4 massages.\nDid hear some complaints about the food but if you don't try to cram a bit of everything on the plate, there is plenty of choice. Sweets are very good.\nThe best thing about the hotel is the friendliness of the staff, particular mention goes to Sherif and Mohammed in the Italian restaurant. \nOne last thought, take plenty of usd or sterling for the best deals.",
