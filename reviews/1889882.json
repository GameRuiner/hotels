      "text": "We had a fantastic business trip experience at the Auris Boutique Hotel (1BHK) in Al Barsha, Dubai from Feb 26th to March 2nd, 2024. The impeccably decorated room with a king-size bed exceeded expectations, and the kitchen offered convenient dining options. Mr. Tazul's exceptional service truly impressed us. The location, near the metro and walking distance to restaurants and the Mall of Emirates, was perfect. Thank you for making our trip memorable!",

Rest others were also very friendly and helpful. I stayed in a 1 BHK apartment which had good kitchen facility but the utensils can be of a good standard as it is used to the core. Not really great for people who want to cook daily. Rest all was excellent. Will come and stay again next time.",
