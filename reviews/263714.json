      "text": "This is my Third or fourth visit to this hotel and is my hotel of choice when it is available as i visit quite a bit to watch fcb play.\nIt is a basic one star hotel so if you want  or expect more then do not bother coming here.\nThe location is fantastic and is right on La Ramblas so all bars and restaurants are on your door step as well as all public transport and the nearest metro station is Liceu.\nThe room is basic and has two sockets one in the bathroom and a small two way extension socket which is hanging where the tv was plugged so worth taking your own extension lead as no sockets next to the bed.\nThe hotel and room is spotless and towels are changed every day and room cleaned every day too.\nThe shower was superb always warm and good and powerful and with regards to the internet it was okay but sometimes lagged a little but could have something to do with us being on third floor as not had issue before with internet.\nBeds are really comfy and there is one cupboard at side of bed and a wardrobe as you walk in the room with hangers so enough storage for a weekend break.\nOur room had an inner city view but some rooms do have a view of the Placa but you can pay extra for them or sometimes you just get one but that is pot luck\nBreakfast is from 8.00am till 10.00am and consists of croissants two types of bread roll  fresh orange a machine that has coffee/hot chocolate and there are marmalade/jams/yoghurts and cake buns and cereal.\nMy only issue with breakfast is the give you a couple of types of bread roll but give you nothing to put on them could do with ham or cheese unless you lime jam butties.\nCheck in is 3pm and you will generally not get in your room before this time and check out time is 11.00am.\nThe lift is quite small and i would say this hotel is not really suited to anyone with walking difficulties or wheel chair users.\nThe hotel staff are okay and if you have any issues they will always try and help you also now the hotel has its own bar and restaurant next door which is an addition since i last visited so great if you want a late night drink.\nIf you want a basic hotel which is clean safe for a short city break i would recommend  this hotel no problem at all which is why i keep coming back.\n\n",

The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location in Plaça Reial was superb, the plaça was lively and vibrant the whole time we were there. This was the only slight drawback, despite double glazing it is quite noisy in the early hours of the morning, apparently, according to my wife. I slept well. \nBreakfast was good, if simple, bread, croissant, cereal, cake, coffee and juice.",
