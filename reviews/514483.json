      "text": "There are more positive points than bad, which was a relief after reading so many negative reviews before we came. We did have a great time, but there are some things to mention for sure.\n\nCheck-in/Our Room\n\nFirstly, our check-in needs highlighting. It was very late at night, and we were greeted at the desk by a friendly chap and told our room number, but very little information was given after that. Mehmet helped with our luggage and advised us of a few things, but we still had no clue what time food was served or any mention of our included à la carte, which was very poor.\n\nUpon arrival at our room, we discovered it looked nothing like the pictures advertised on the Jet2 website. We were also with our 15-year-old daughter and were greeted with a single room with three single beds in it. I spoke to our porter and showed him my room confirmation, and he said this was correct; we had booked a standard room. I then went back upstairs to speak to the man on reception and told him that there should be a double bed and that the pictures looked nothing like the ones on the website. Language was a bit of an issue clearly, and he would not let me upgrade. I was just told to come back tomorrow to speak with the manager on the desk.\n\nThis was annoying, and in the end, we didn't even bother going back to complain. The complex is massive, and they really should have looked at the booking and saw we had a teenager with us and accommodated this. The hotel wasn't even half full. Most \"5-star\" hotels upgrade for free. We literally got a 2-star room (not very clean, nothing like the pictures, the air conditioning barely worked and was incredibly noisy). If it weren't for the staff and everything else, I would not be rating this review so high.\n\nOur neighbor upon our arrival said \"welcome to Alcatraz,\" and it did feel a bit like that with apartments close together. We didn't get the promised balcony; it was just a small step with two chairs on it, with no privacy. I won't moan about the room too much as we didn't go back the next day to complain further, but make sure you get one that is in the pictures on your travel company's website.\n\nWe did leave a couple of tips for the housekeepers, but the cleaning wasn't great. You didn't get any special treatment like swans made out of towels, but you did get your bed made and minibar stocked, so it's not all bad.\n\nBe warned, they like you to put toilet paper in the bin. Nothing was mentioned about this apart from a card in the bathroom. I remember first encountering this many years ago in Corfu, but I would hope in this day and age, you didn't have to wipe and leave it in a bin.\n\nThe Staff\n\nThe staff are the highlight of this place, though. Some do not really engage (perhaps a language issue), but there are some absolute stars there, such as Nazmi (breakfast), Yusef Can (bar), and others whose names I have forgotten how to pronounce. Thank you all for such great service.\n\nThe Complex\n\nThe complex itself is like a little village with absolutely stunning views over the harbor. The beach, although it's quite small and gritty, has some fantastic piers with lots of sunbeds and cabanas (which you can rent, but who knows how much, and nothing was mentioned to us). We were blessed with the weather thankfully and made use of the pool, beach, and piers during our stay. Sunbeds were not an issue; there are so many.\n\nThe pool was naturally very cold but refreshing as well, and it was very clean.\n\nWe saw a few friendly dogs on the complex too as expected with Turkey but they were all very friendly, lots of cats and kittens too. \n\nThe Food\n\nThere were lots of options, but it did become a bit repetitive over the five days, and as the season was closing, food stations were closed down. The kitchen and waiting team worked exceptionally hard, though, and I won't take it away from them. We did go out into Bodrum and other areas to eat at some of the places we researched before going, so that was nice for a change of scenery.\n\nThe Kumpir hatch was closed, but you could get waffles and toasties by the pool bar, which was nice for a quick bite. The Gozleme station is down by the beach, but I do think it needs to be relocated. We only went once, and the woman asked me for a tip by pointing to the tip box. I have no problem with tipping; I did it a lot to the staff, but I did feel it was a bit rude. Equally though, I felt sorry for her being so out of the way.\n\nThe 7/24 bar was always open for pizzas and burgers, and the staff there were very friendly. However, I came to Turkey for Turkish food, and there was a lack of it. I would have loved to see some kebabs, lahmacun, or manti as an option.\n\nAll-Inclusive What?\n\nThe claim of it being All Inclusive Plus was a bit misleading. I only actually saw Gordon's Gin, Jägermeister, and a popular whiskey that I can't remember the name of. Otherwise, they used cheaper spirits. They had Efes on tap, which is always nice, but it was very limited. The cocktails were very sweet, but you could get a half-decent one if you found the right bartender. We visited towards the end of the season, so perhaps it's better during the height of summer.\n\nThe Area\n\nThe town of Gumbet itself isn't the best. Some of the shopkeepers were great fun to barter with, while others just shoved clothes into your bag to make more money. It's nothing like Lara Beach, where yes, you get hassled, but this was on a whole other level in some shops. Bodrum is the same, but we did enjoy visiting the city.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, we enjoyed it. If you like it quiet, the end of the season might be a good time to go. However, be warned that they do wind down, so food options and entertainment are limited. I imagine the busy season would be intense, but most places are!",

All the staff were very good, comments about looking after the Turkish customers 1st we didnt witness any of that.\n\nWaterslides were surprisingly good and loved sitting on the beach at the beach bar as the sun went down , just a short stroll into Gumbet to pick up lots of bargains a bonus.\n\nThere are a lot of steps, but if needed there is a lift.\n\nWe got the Dolmus bus into Bodrum a couple of times, 57p per person each way!, but there really was no need.\n\nReally loved stating here",
