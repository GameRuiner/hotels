Moskitos too.\nIf you get any service you will be promptly asked for tip. \nIf you do not give enough you will get a chance to do better the next day. (!!)\nCalling reception ends up with a recording, telling you: temporarily out of service.\nMy request for early check in was ignored 4 times by several different receptionist.\nThey just charged my credit card and let me wait for many hours.\nAt least I was waiting long enough to figure that more people had complaints.....\nJust don't go there!",

The fixtures and fittings are just plain spot on!\nThe bed was comfortable, two sorts of pillows, the bathroom was great with a really good shower.  The room had a Nespresso machine which was useful as the coffee in the restaurant at breakfast was undrinkable.\nThe location has plenty of cafes and far too many shops selling spices, pashminas etc- BUT the spruikers outside the shops were actually nice and not overly percistent.\nThe breakfast was an accetable buffet with freshly made omlettes.  However,did I mention the coffee the coffee was diabolical?  ( Yes, I am from Melbourne and a coffee snob).\nThere was access to RTA ferries and all sorts of 'small' boat rides, a metro station about 30 minutes walk away too. \nI loved the hotel and complex.  Sure, it is a bit-Disneyland but honestly done so well that it feels really old.",
