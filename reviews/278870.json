We stayed in room 2210 with a stunning view, clean and very spacious great design. The food at the resort was amazing, the buffet was very various and fresh. The bars were also very good. We loved the Pinacoladas;))\n\nWe warmly recommend this 5-star hotel - for a great experience . What tell you the difference between a 5-star hotel from another is The Staff !\nThe Staff are the BEST very kind, service minded and devoted. You can tell they are happy employees- they care soo much towards the customers and each other as colleagues.\n\nPlease forward this to everyone working at Helea, we will not mention names we are afraid we will miss out on mention someone since everyone need and deserve to hear this!!

      "text": "I don’t understand the positive reviews about this hotel and maybe it’s more positive if you are there with children.  \nWe were there as a couple and I will give the positives and then the negatives as we found them.\n\nPositives\nThe hotel wasn’t too far from the airport (around 35 minute drive).\nOn arrival we were greeted by George on reception who made us feel very welcome and provided all of the information we needed for our stay. He was very good.\n\nNegatives \nDespite the hotel being fairly new it seems to have been well worn and bashed in most areas. It has gone for the current trend of not painting walls,  just leaving the render on the wall. This gives it an unfinished feel and if you are unlucky enough to brush against a wall it will probably also give you that loss of skin feeling!\n\nAfter check in we went to our room. It was on the ground floor and was a swim up room. Because it was so low down it was quite dark and made us feel like we were staying in a cave. Unfortunately our swim up area was the last in the block and did not seem to get sun at any part of the day. When we looked out it was pretty miserable and was almost on the road as our photos show. This was room 1002. The area has not established its shrubs yet we were at the wall.\nThe room also had quite a lot of cob webs in the bathroom and had the appearance that it had not been used in a long time. I walked about for 5 minutes in my bare feet in the room and had to wash them before I could put my shoes on (as shown in photos).\n\nBecause we arrived into the hotel late we missed the buffet but the hotel asked if we would like cold plates of fruit and sandwiches delivered. We said yes and thought this was a lovely gesture. We then went to the bar to get a drink whilst we waited on our cold plates. We went to the only bar that was open (at around 9:30pm) and were fairly disappointed to see a queue of about 15 -20 people at the bar waiting for drinks. There seemed to be 2 people serving. We waited for about 5 minutes and didn’t move in the queue so gave that up as a bad job and went back to our room. When we arrived the “fruit plate” had been delivered. This turned out to be a paper bag with a stale sandwich and an apple and orange- not exactly a fruit plate and all seemed like it had seen better days.\n\nThe next morning we went for breakfast in the buffet. This is where things went from disappointing to horrendous. There were kids running around everywhere, some were wrestling on the floor in the eating area and I did notice at least 2 who lifted food from the buffet, looked at it and set it back in again??\nAfter selecting some food we walked around for about 10 mins trying to find somewhere to sit. Eventually we ended up sitting at an empty table and grabbing some cutlery etc ourselves. I went to get a coffee only to find there were no cups available at that time. I also asked for a tea bag and was told that they only had fruit flavoured tea.\n\nWe left the chaos of breakfast and went to guest relations and spoke to Alex to try to book speciality restaurants. Never have I met a less customer focussed “guest relations” representative. He was rude, condescending and unhelpful.\n\nWe had a walk down to the beach and thought we might get a beer at the beach bar. I believe it opens at 12. We arrived 15 minutes before it opened and there was already a queue of about 10 people waiting at the shutter to get a drink.\n\nWe had had enough at this point and could not imagine spending another meal in that buffet. We checked out of the hotel that afternoon and went to stay at the Mayia resort and spa instead.\n\nWe spoke to the manager when we were leaving and thankfully his customer service was better than expected. \n\nIf you want peace and quiet this is not the hotel for you. If you do not want to queue for a minimum of 15 minutes each time you want a drink then it is not the hotel for you. If you want clean and modern facilities with great customer service from all staff then this is not the hotel for you.",
