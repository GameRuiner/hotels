      "text": "This turned out to be a very convenient choice overall for Barcelona and area.  It was booked primarily because it would be good for doing some day trips by train from Barcelona, and for that it was excellent.  However, it also turned out to be fine for exploring Barcelona in general, due to good access to the subway and the Hop-on/Hop-off Bus.  \n\nI was in a 'Stratosphere' room, which was comfortable and bright, with a reasonable amount of storage.  The bathroom had a rather strange setup, with separate rooms for the toilet and the shower, and an open area for the vanity/sink, but functionally it worked well.  I didn't find noise to be an issue, as some other reviews have suggested, but perhaps I simply had quiet neighbours.  The windows must be effective, as very little traffic noise penetrated into the room.   The only issue I found with the room was that the electrically-operated blinds did not always fully close.  WIFI was good.  \n\nThe breakfast room was huge, so it always had enough seating spaces for people eating breakfast.   The breakfast buffet was excellent but expensive.  If you are not a breakfast person, it would be much cheaper to go to one of the coffee or bakery places in the train station nearby (which are also convenient for picking up drinks or snacks in the afternoon or evening).\n\nOne thing that was useful was their luggage storage, as I was coming off a cruise first thing in the morning but couldn't check in until later in the day.  The front desk people kept the luggage until later in the afternoon, when checkin was possible.\n\nThe red line of the hop-on/hop-off bus stopped very close to the hotel, just across the street on the north side of the hotel, which was useful.  One other thing that was very convenient was the bus to Montserrat, operated by the Julia line.  The front desk was not even aware that this existed, but it does, at least on most days: one bus a day, leaving at 9:15 AM and returning from Montserrat at around 6 PM (5 PM in low season, I think).  It was great for a day trip to Montserrat, and was very reasonably priced.  You catch the bus at the bus station across the street to the northwest of the hotel, on the north side of the bus station (C/ de Viriat), and pay the driver.  \n\nIncidentally, all the front-desk people I dealt with spoke very good English.\n\nOverall, despite the over-priced breakfast, this was a good place to stay.",

      "text": "The major strength of this hotel is convenience if you are traveling by train. We stayed twice in the last fortnight on our way south to Seville. Having taken a long train journey from the UK to Barcelona it is lovely to be able to take a lift from the station at Barcelona Santa straight up to the hotel. The reception staff are efficient and friendly. The whole place is a little tired and the space theme feels dated. The rooms are ok. On the cramped side even the stratosphere rooms which are supposedly superior rooms. The beds are very comfortable as are the pillows. The lighting is annoyingly weak. Lots of switches but the rooms never feel bright. Think it might be a continuation of the space theme. On our second visit in the last two weeks we discovered a clump of hair on the wall of the shower. We didn't have showers on the evening of arrival so only spotted it on the morning of departure. The desk were apologetic. We had breakfast on each stay. Again it's ok, what you'd expect from a hotel buffet breakfast. On our latest stay, last night, the breakfast this morning did not include the signature fresh omlettes. This was disappointing. Our stay coincided with a large group booking of children and adults attending a football event. Think that might have been why our stay was substantially more expensive last night. All together slightly disappointed this time.",
