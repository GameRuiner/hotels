The hotel has had some excellent improvements made including the Waterpark and restaurants including the Bussola beach bar which was a new addition since our last visit.\nThe grounds are still beautifully maintained and the staff are still extremely friendly and professional.\nA special shout out to Damaciano Fernandes who was exceptionally friendly helping with sun beds everyday - what a fantastic guy he is. \nAlso Amiya who looked after our rooms everyday - he did a great job and always had a smile on his face. Thank you Amiya.\nWe will definitely be back.",

      "text": "This was only our second visit to Dubai, and our first to this resort following lots of recommendations.\n\nWhilst initially we were underwhelmed with the service at the resort in the first few days, we will still award this resort a 5 star review, as the early disappointment was quickly more than compensated for with some of the best service we have experienced thereafter.\n\nSpecial thanks to all of the staff, especially those pool and beach side, and I must pay particular reference to the wonderful Damaciano Fernandez who was just so attentive and was brilliant tending to every need and request of our family. He was brilliant with the children in particular.\n\nAnother mention to the one and only Prem. He looked after us most days by the pool with regular and prompt top ups on food and drinks. Always with a smiling happy demeanor.\n\nThe food at all of the restaurants has been absolutely top drawer, and the bubblicious brunch was a truly unforgettably indulgent experience - we’ve never seen anything like it!\n\nThe interconnecting rooms we had were spotless and huge, and accommodated my wife and I and four children perfectly.\n\nThe kids loved all the pools and of course the Waterpark. And we continue to be mesmerised by the scenery in and around the resort. Drinks at the back of the Italian overlooking the Marina is really very special, alongside the fish restaurant too.\n\nWe’ll certainly be back!",

      "text": "Stayed in Westin in March 2024. There are no e-mail on web site to send my feedback, so have to place it here. Although at reception I`ve been told that I would receive feedback form in 3 days after departure.\nGood points:\nGreat lobby\nrooms are good, but not very new renovated, especially bathroom\nvery comfortable bed\nfood at Main restaurant is delicious for breakfast and for dinner ( you can find everything there, even fresh juices for breakfast)\nbeach is clean, sun beds are comfortable, you will receive free bottle of water on the beach ( but if you want second bottle is chargeable)\ngreat night bar on the beach with fantastic view\n\nsome areas for improvement:\nthe biggest disappointment is service at main restaurant. In the evening restaurant was always full (with external guests for Iftar), we always have been asked to come after 20:00. It`s ok, we can wait till 20:00, no problem, but then you come after 20:00 most of the food is already not available, barbeque on terrace is already cold, ice cream is finished. I thing in such high level hotel service/food in the restaurant should be the same during whole period of dinner. Especially  during Ramadan, then you have external guests and hotel is full with own guests. When you want to seat outside on the terrace, you always will be refused due to unavailability of seats. But I always can find a lot of free tables there myself. \nOn check in I`ve been upgraded to sea view room, we were very happy, but it seems that sea view room is not a best option there, that`s why they easily upgraded all our rooms. First of all smell and smoke of barbeque from main restaurant is almost in you room. Construction works opposite Marina is going 24 hrs, so you can hear it whole night. Also Wesitn garden employees with vacuum cleaner were working every night at 02:00 a.m and 05:00 a.m. This vacuum cleaner is very noisy and we couldn`t sleep whole night ( every night)\nBeach is very good, but as sea is closed by Marina and due to ebb and flow beach became a bog or puddle after 14:00. \nBut in general hotel is not bad, I am happy to return again, but some improvements should be done there.",

      "text": "We stayed for 5 nights over the Easter break. \nThe hotel is beautiful. We had a nice room on the third floor with a great view over the marina. \nThe food was amazing with the most bearable buffet we’ve ever experienced. \nStaff were very friendly and helpful. \nThe grounds, pool and beach are pristine. \n\nThe in-room toiletries were disappointing with pump bottles bolted to the wall and one teeny tiny bottle of Elemis moisturiser. \n\nWe stayed on an all inclusive basis, which we felt the hotel didn’t really want to do. We weren’t allowed to order a whole bottle of wine at dinner, and there were restrictions on the number of side dishes at Baba’s steakhouse. Room service was also chargeable. \nWe usually stay at ultra all inclusive hotels (IKOS etc) so this all came as a bit of a surprise and made us feel like 2nd class citizens to be honest. \nIf the hotel doesn’t like all inclusive guests- stop offering it.",
