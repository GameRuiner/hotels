      "text": "I stayed with my family in this hotel for 4 nights. Our room was a classic king size bed furnished with a nice mattress with no enough sitting area (we had 6 baggage full of gifts and personal items ;) ). If you need more space, you may consider upgrading your room to other available classes. It was fairly clean with really nice air conditioning system. The staff at the reception were really nice and friendly. Room service was fine and the food quality was acceptable. Despite these positivities, I had my worst life experience in this hotel. During our stay at this hotel, we refused to have room cleaning service except the last day and it was our biggest mistake. After cleaning service we never checked our baggage and when we returned home in the following day we noticed a few small items are missing from our baggage. I immediately initiated a complaint email to hotel management asking for investigation. The hotel management replied me granting an investigation however the email in the following day was discouraging. I was told their investigation shows no evidence of security breach in my room. I was not expecting a compensation and I wanted to raise awareness and protect the others. If you are planning to stay at this hotel, take more care of your valuable items specially the small size ones. There is a risk of having stolen items from your baggage.",
