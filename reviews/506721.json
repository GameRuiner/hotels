      "text": "We had a family vacation from 28March till 9th April. Best holiday ever. Everything about the hotel is excellent and five star. The staff are excellent. Food is amazing with lots of choices. There is a separate section for kids buffet as well. There are ample sun beds. There are 5-6 pools. The main attraction is the water park which keeps the kids busy and entertained. The TUI kids club was incredible as well. The weather at Rhodes was great in mid 20s. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",

      "text": "Where to start!\nArrival was the first time we arrived and greeted with food. At 0100 in morning, great for the kids as they travelled all day.\nThe room was very clean and the maids kept this to a high standard though out our 10days.\nThe food varied from amazing variety to routine display after the 7th day. All well presented and great choices for all. From  English, Greek, and other mixed nights.\nThe speciality restaurants are a great break up. The Asia is a must the kids, they'll love sticky fingers with the ribs. \n\nThe pool areas are very clean and the life guards are on point. However be mindful if you want the infinity pool and the pool bar. This is a quiet area. No music or ball games etc. \nonly thing I found strange it‚Äôs the only holiday I‚Äôve ever been to where you can‚Äôt dive in any pool. \nWow; the water park is brilliant for all, it might get busier but this was brilliant for the kids and adults who like to act like kids ü§£\n\nLocation: is five stars, lovely walk up the mountain, takes 45 mins with amazing views over the bay and to the distance. \n\nVisits; Recommend hiring a car some great days trips out and about. Not far from Rhodes or Lindos. \nSymi island is a must, slightly expensive but worth the money and the day. While there a walk up the hill to the church is breath taking. Expect to pay London prices for drinks.  \n\nStaff! OMG. They couldn‚Äôt be any more helpful. A big shout out to them all. From guest relations, the bar staff, waiters in restaurants and the maids. We had an amazing experience and would love to revisit this location.\n\nWe did visit during opening period and as we was leaving it‚Äôs got a lot busier. I do truely hope this standard of service we got carries on for the remaining season.\nA special thank you to: Eleftheria,  Tsabikos And his wife , Nikos, and Sevastos, these always went the extra mile. Also a thank you to the  TUI reps, Sarah and her team ‚ù§Ô∏è",

It‚Äôs like a Travel Lodge in the sun. \n\nFrom the moment you walk in to the bare foyer with the faux lime green leather/plastic square sofas to the bare minimum rooms with no toiletries and cheap soap dispensers on the walls, it is basic and 3 stars at a push.\n\nThe all inclusive food offered is absolutely disgusting, it‚Äôs all greasy, horrible, cheap fast food, with very limited fresh salad, fruit or fresh sea food on offer. The drinks on offer are also cheap and horrible. They only offer 1 type of red and white wine, poured from a big plastic, unlabelled, vat. The gin and tonic was a gin and cheap lemonade and the aperole (no) spritz was made with flat white wine and flat lemonade. It‚Äôs positively rank. \n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs really cheap, where you can eat greasy, fast food on demand and don‚Äôt care about what alcohol you drink as long as it‚Äôs alcoholic and free, with a good pool, then I imagine you‚Äôll like it here but if you‚Äôre actually looking for a nice 5 star resort, with decent food, then avoid, avoid, avoid‚Ä¶..

      "text": "We are here currently, and it‚Äôs amazing! Our first time visiting abroad, however the staff here have put our minds at ease. All so welcoming and friendly. Always saying good morning/hello etc whenever they walk by. \n\nWe have found the food variety very good, we are fussy eaters and feel comfortable to know there are foods we love as well as a good choice of things we can try. The waiting staff are superb and can always be seen working very hard to ensure guests are well looked after. Entertainment is very good, we have enjoyed the evening shows very much! \n\nThe pools are amazing! - although a little cold when you first dip your toes in, but I think that‚Äôs more due to the time of year we have visited as it‚Äôs still early season. Plenty of places to sit by the pool, we‚Äôve not struggled at all this week to find the perfect spot. \n\nOnly downside, is we have struggled to book one of the a la carte restaurants, which is a shame! - but I guess they‚Äôve been super popular, we are happy with other options so not a huge issue for us. \n\nThe rooms are lush! The bed and pillows are SO comfy, perfect for a good nights sleep. The kids have enjoyed their bunk beds. We chose an inland room, which is perfect for us as it‚Äôs away from all the usual noise of restaurant/pool/entertainment areas. We haven‚Äôt been bothered by the traffic of coaches etc as it‚Äôs peaceful as night and the balcony door cancels noise out. \n\nOur new favourite spot is the quiet little area at the end of the hotel by the pool, you can sit at the waters edge and look out in to the beautiful blue sea. So peaceful. \n\nWe are enjoying our stay so much, we are looking at another visit for next year. Highly recommend this hotel.",
