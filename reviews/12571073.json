The last part  where the legs are folded down as soon as I sat on it and I fell! FYI, worst part is there is no bathroom, no shower. Zero! You have to go out and find toilet or a shower place.  Very inconvenient!  Not coming back.",

Since my daughter wasn't feeling well, they kindly allowed us to check in early. We were able to get the much-needed rest in a comfortable sleep pod. The place was quiet, and we were able to rest peacefully. Additionally, the pod's convenient location within the airport made it easy for us to reach our check-in gate. I'll definitely be booking a pod again the next time I have a long layover while traveling.",
