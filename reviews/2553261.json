      "text": "We had a wonderful stay and have enjoyed the quiet and comfortable staycation in the spacious 2-bedroom apartment.  I booked a one-bedroom apartment but was upgraded to a two-bedroom place because it was my birthday staycation. The apartment is very spacious with all the amenities you can find in a living space. It has a separate laundry room too.  The bedrooms are also huge and the master bedroom even has a walk-in closet. The apartment is perfect for families or groups of 3-4 persons.  Staff are all friendly and very courteous. I had the same very satisfying experience even on the first time I had stayed in Swissotel. And this staycation was the 2nd. Great location too as it is connected to the Al Ghurair Mall in Deira. You can park for free in the mall's parking space or use the metro to get around the city. Taxis are available too. The breakfast buffet is nice and have plenty of selections.  Overall, our stay is very satisfying.",
