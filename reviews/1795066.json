      "text": "I very rarely give a bad review because I try to appreciate every small gesture, but this hotel gave me absolutely nothing to appreciate. Choking in to this hotel felt like checking into a prison! It was the most dry and rude experience I have ever had in any hotel around the world! I only received orders, the front desk employees did not speak any English, and later on when I asked why does nobody here speak a few words in English comparing to Cappadocia where everyone spoke English, the answer I received was :”Izmir is not a touristic city”!!! what a BS! Nobody working in the Hospitality Industry should ever give an answer like that.\nThe hotel itself is VERY OLD, completely deteriorated, and it looks nothing like the pictures you see online. The rooms are rusty and falling apart, and the carpet is very dirty and smelly. I requested a smoke free room, and I was given a room in the smoke free floor, however the whole floor reeked with the smell of cigarettes and cigar! I struggles with my asthma attacks during the whole stay in that hotel.\nThe breakfast was MISERABLE! The restaurant looked worst than a hospital cafeteria! There was only one employee preparing the food and managing the restaurant. Breakfast consisted of a couple fried pastries, 2 tomatoes 3 pieces of cheese, one boiled egg, some pieces of cucumber and a few salad leaves.\nWhen I checked out, I found out that I was charged in EURO which was the highest currency! This hotel is a complete fraud. I paid the cost of a 4 star hotel and I felt completely ripped off. I am writing this review because I don’t want anyone else to go through this experience, vacation days are very valuable!",
