      "text": "The Lobby of this hotel is very pretty, and the rooms are clean and spacious. Izmir is a diverse city , I wouldn't particularity recommend Basmane for a long-time stay, but if it's for a few nights you'll be okay - the konak pier is very close by with the tram, where you can get a ferryboat across the city. The staff are kind, efficient and lovely people - the night staff , the people working in the morning, everybody is very helpful.  For the people who are commenting on the English of the staff - their English was perfectly fine, and being a guest in a Turkish Hotel, you should understand that not everybody will accomodate for you completely with language. It would be great for guests to learn a little Turkish before complaining about the English of the staff. \n\nI would recommend this hotel to people who are looking for a work trip hotel, short stay - or a place to sleep after travelling the city all day :-)",
