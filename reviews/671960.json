      "text": "I always say if you want 5* youâ€™ve got to pay 5* prices!! Itâ€™s good value for the money we paid. \n\nThe hotel is nice, the pools and beach are amazing. The housekeeping needs some attention, the biggest let down here is the foodâ€¦â€¦. itâ€™s really bad!!! You have an omelette bar for breakfast and a pasta bar at lunch/dinner to fall back on but itâ€™s all we really ate for the 8 days we were here as the buffet selection is shocking!!! Iâ€™m not much of a fussy eater but i was struggling. There are enough bars with a good â€˜localâ€™ selection, and a plus is you can drink from 10.00 - 00.00. \nThe staff struggle with English but my Arabic isnâ€™t all that either. \nYouâ€™ll get much better service if you own female genitalia, the service staff are on heat when they see a womenâ€¦..\nApart from the entertainment team the rest of the workforce are male. \nI generally tip good service staff at the end of my trip and this was no exception but i hate being asked for a tip which happened on a good few occasions. \n\nThe people who earn their wages are the garden maintenance team. The grounds are beautiful. credit to their hard work. \n\nI wouldnâ€™t deter anyone away from the hotel but iâ€™d like you all to know the food is a massive let down. \n\nHappy holidays to you all wherever you may go ðŸŒž",

      "text": "The hotel is one of my worst experiences, and I don't even know where to start. Firstly, the staff at the reception are very pushy, trying to charge as much as possible for any additional services. Actually, I think it's not even allowed to charge as it is all inclusive. Secondly, they don't speak English very well, which makes communication with them much more difficult. The hotel is full of Russian tourists, so if you want a peaceful vacation, you won't get it here, as Russians are very loud, pushy, rude, and... The food here is so bad that I've probably never had such a terrible food experience. Breakfasts are exactly the same every morning. The only good thing is that they prepare an omlette according to your wishes. But lunch and dinner seem to get worse every day; it feels like they're making food from leftovers.\n\nI think itâ€™s very rude for the receptionist to ask for 30 euros for a late check-out when I only wanted a few extra hours in the hotel so I could take a shower before leaving. The only person in the hotel who has been nice to me is the bartender near the pool. He is very friendly and polite. The sea here is indeed very pleasant and warm, but itâ€™s absolutely not suitable for children. Itâ€™s not clean, and there are many objects on the shore that could harm children. The room service is fast. The bed is made nicely, but the cleaning could be better. There is mold visible in the bathtub, and thereâ€™s a musty smell. The rooms are very large and have a big balcony. Thatâ€™s a big plus, but unfortunately, I canâ€™t find any other good qualities about my room.\n\nI wouldnâ€™t recommend letting the hotel staff help you around cause they are asking for a tip with every move. Additionally, the alcohol served here within the all-inclusive package is absolutely terrible. First of all, drinks are served in plastic cups. They all taste the same and are made from very, very sweet syrup. Even the ice cream tastes exactly the same as these juices.\n\nIn the end, I want to say that this is my worst hotel experience, and definitely, if I ever come back to Egypt, I will avoid this hotel and certainly not recommend it to my friends. The only good thing about this hotel stay is that everyone who earns the lowest wage here is actually the friendliest and most helpful. Whether itâ€™s the cleaners or those who help at the bar with cocktails or those who arrange the lounge chairs or towels. All in all, this hotel is definitely a two-star hotel, not a four-star hotel. If you want a peaceful and pleasant vacation, donâ€™t come to this hotel.",

      "text": "This was a last minute booking to get away from the miserable weather of the UK. It's out of season so low capacity (about 100 families) and not many other solo travellers. But that personally made the experience better as there were no queues and very little noise.\n\nThe staff were very nice, welcoming and helpful. The overall vibe was tranquil and pleasant. Food was nice with freshly made omelettes at breakfast, and various options for dinner. Some foods were a little bland but they were catering for an array of people.\n\nRooms were spacious and cleaned daily. Maybe not exactly a 4 star resort (3.5 maybe?) but again, that didn't detract from the overall experience. Would happily come again",
