They have only non-smoking rooms so it was perfect for me being sensitive to cigarettes’ smell.\nBreakfast was also good I just really hope they will keep up this high standards. I will definitely come back again.\nStaff were super friendly specially Tina. Always smiling and assisting guests. She was a star.",
