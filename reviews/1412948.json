      "text": "This place is sooooo big it's like town. Our first allocation wasn't ideal. Although it was a huge apartment we were far from the pool with slides where the kids wanted to be every day and they changed us with no extra cost to a room with a private pool. The change was made with no fuss and they porter collected us and drove us to the new room. The room was small but we weren't there to sit around the room and the pool was a great touch. \n\nThe kids had so much fun at this hotel, it was their first experience of an all inclusive and they loved going to get food and drinks and snacks. The pool is great fun and so warm. It gets a bit dirty around the pool as people just leave with cups everywhere and bins are overflowing so more attention to this would be great. The staff everywhere are great and you don't want to leave them at the end of your holiday! The restaurants that you need to book for really aren't worth it (sorry) and we're hard to book anyway. The self service buffet restaurant has loads of variety and has some nice choices but like every all inclusive it gets a bit much and we did eat out a bit but it's fine for breakfast and lunch. \n\nI would recommend Lindos imperial but know it's not really 5 star and it's a little rough round the edges but the staff made up for that as they are lovely. I was sorry to see the fires in Rhodes, I hope the hotel is ok and they get through it. For water sports we loved Alexis and his family run business on the little beach a 10 minute coastal walk to left. My son did wakeboarding and the whole family did the jetskis with them.  Equally the English family who have their water sports on the beach just next to the hotel were lovely too and complete pros. We did the \"sofa\" and tandem \"parasailing\" with them.",

Sorry if i didn‚Äôt spell it right but she was amazing and really friendly. Justin from the activity people was also such a friendly soul. There was a 20 min bus ride you could get to Lindos which has the most beautiful beach and it‚Äôs a lovely little town. The rooms were good and the buffet is nothing to complain about it is what you‚Äôd expect from an all inclusive holiday.",

Everything can be booked on the App so all documents & info are in one place - handy. The hotel was great with a private pool on our terrace. All the staff in every department were superb, friendly & knowledgeable as were the locals, despite being devastated by the wild fires. The all inclusive resort catered for all tastes from the beach & poolside caf√©'s to the buffet style main restaurant & also 5 \nthemed restaurants which was nice to be waited on occasionally. The steak one was our favourite. \nWe hired a car for the duration which was reasonable costwise & gave us the freedom to explore the island at our own pace, without being tied to excursion timings or public transport. Every attraction we visited was enjoyable with spectacular scenery & the boat trip to Symi is a must. \nWe only remained on resort 3 days out of 10 as there was so much to visit. We were so impressed with the organisation of Jet2, hotel, staff, locals of Rhodes that we plan to return in 2024 to complete our island exploring & maybe chill out more at the hotel beach, 5 different pools or even book another private pool to relax at. Very impressed üòäüëç",

Hotel, pool areas and rooms were all very clean and provided a nice relaxed area. Food was very good, especially in the A-la-Carte restaurants - unfortunately only being here for a week we didn't have the chance to try them all!  Evening entertainment in the main bar was excellent, and the star gazing night very interesting and informative.  Only downside was the beach (pebbles) and sea. As not very good swimmers we decided to stick to the pools.  Whilst there was visual evidence of the terrible fires experienced earlier in the year, there was no evident damage to the hotel. A trip to Lindos via the daily water 'taxi' which pics up at the hotel beach front is highly recommended. ",
