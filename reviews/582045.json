All personal was especially pleasant and in particular with my 6 years old daughter. I strongly recommend this apartments for everyone due to the location was perfect - 10 mins till the Metro station, supermarkets near the hotel. The bedroom bed was huge and comfortable. In the kitchen you can find everything what you need - plates, spoons, forks, pan, pots, cups and everything else. The bottle of still water we got everyday. Thank You for the warm welcome, I think we will come back.",
