Spacious rooms, comfortable and big beds, good quality linen, towels and toiletries. \nVery nice a la cart restaurants ðŸ‘Œ,  decent variety of food in the main restaurant, excellent pool bar, huge beach equipped with comfortable beds/matrasses, giant, soft towels. \nSpecial thanks and respect to each and everyone from Front Desk Team!

      "text": "Second time at this resort. Same like the others, I suppose - I just wanted to know what to expect. This resort is very good indeed. It is very clean and the food is very good too. If you are a picky eater and want to know what to eat, you can opt for the a la carte restaurants which are unlimited. However, the bufet is impressive too. Sometimes, there arenâ€™t enough signs for the sauces and you have to guess what is what especially by the salad corners. If you are a food lover, you will love this. There are so many different kinds of food, at times you think too much. All of this from the desire to please all the customers. There are several Russians salads and Eastern European dishes, lots of German food, arabic traditional food, and of course the classics pasta station, chips and meats. Every evening there was grilled meats and roasted chicken and beef. Lots of sauces and stews covering different cultures and cuisines were available. Fruit and salads were delicious and plentiful. This is a paradise for vegetarians and vegans. So many delicious grilled veg and falafel and hummus and spreads. Lunch was great with fresh pizza to order and fresh cips and delicious burgers at the terrace/ snack bar if you want to skip the main buffet. The keeping of the hotel grounds is fantastic. The amount of workers caring for this place is incredible. From\nThe gardens, the rooms, the restaurants to the cleaners.  I have never walked into a dirty toilet in my entire stay. There is someone cleaning all the time, including at the beach. Always spotless. \nThe rooms are not luxurious. We stayed in a family room and it is adequate and clean. Whatever lacks in opulence and luxury, it makes up in the friendliness of the staff. Our room cleaner was brilliant and so was the entire staff throughout. Such hard working people and I am glad that this has not changed. One good thing that has changed is that the animation team and program is even better this time around. The program is packed with activities and more evening shows now that there used to be. There are kids parties, lessons and even a colour and foam party at the beach. They all work very hard and are so friendly. The sellers at the beach might seem a nuisance but they are just trying to do their job. If you say no thank you, they will respect that. Smile and be polite, they will respect you. The smoothies on the beach are delicious. We had a couple for the children and when we tasted them, we decided to buy every day. 3 dollars, make a deal with them and get a discount. The hotel was occupied by Germans mainly and it was a very busy Easter break period with lots of families with children. My children didnâ€™t make many friends as predominantly they were speaking German. Some English too but not too many. My girls only went once to kids club for the pizza making but the ladies seemed nice there. Also, they now provide kids club all day long. They have kids activities from 9 to 22. That is impressive! \nThe only reason why I am not giving it a 5 star is because I would have loved to see some benefits for being a returning costumer. We have booked the hotel separate and not as a package and we didnâ€™t feel it was any better or worse. The room we were given was standard.No upgrades. When we left, we paid for late checkout and for a towel card which we have miss-placed. It would have been nice if that would have been offered to us for free. Would we recommend this hotel? Absolutely!!!!\nWill we return? Maybe! It was a great holiday and we miss the place already.",

Some of use are entrepreneurial the rest is in leading position. If you give the staffs a little tip, they will take so much care of you. They also have some really great animator. I have to mention Michaela, she is such an awesome animator. Also Olivia was such a nice person to meet. We played UNO together we had so much fun. Havenâ€™t laughed  that hard in a long time.
