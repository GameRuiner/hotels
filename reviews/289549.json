We were switched to this hotel, because our allocated hotel could not provide the accommodation we required as it was closing early (end of Season) \nAnd were we glad we were switched\nThe Hotel, the Management, the staff were just fabulous......\nWe had a 4th Floor, Sea View Room with panoramic uninterrupted views of the Mediterranean with the most astonishing sunsets every night.   The room was spacious, contemporary  furnishings, stylish bathroom & shower, very comfortable large bed with  the fridge and the air conditioning  working (which we find to be rare nowadays)  which reflected the whole style of the hotel which was clean, contemporary styles and well managed\n\nin fact the management & staff really made this holiday one of the best holidays we have had\nWe were made so welcome by the whole Hotel stall from the General Mgr. down to the room cleaner who was an absolute delight to see every day with the biggest smile & greeting and of course  our obligatory \"Greek word for the day\" what a treasure she was\nThe Bar staff and in particular the Restaurant Staff were exceptional, so attentive, so friendly, anything we wanted was attended to  as we also noted with other guests at the hotel, the stall friendliness was noted by all, nothing was too much trouble.\n\nThe reception staff were of the same 'ilke'  very helpful very friendly and created a great atmosphere we just felt so comfortable at the hotel  \n\nMichaël the General Mgr. was a delightful man with an engaging personality who had a very active/presence in the hotel with his attentiveness to all the guests, we certainly enjoyed his encounters with ourselves, remarkable memory for guests names etc.  we were very impressed \nStaff to note:   George the Restaurant Mgr.  with his knowledge of wines and professional  service, was impressive, the personal service from the floor staff was so friendly and proficient it made every meal time a pleasurable event.  \nSpecial mention to the Maître d   (Voula)  she had the biggest smile, always took her time to ask about our day and was exceptionally pleasant in the way she interacted with us and other hotel guests,  again a very engaging young lady perfectly placed to be the Maître d.\nAll in all a fabulous holiday for my wife and myself and I can strongly recommend this Hotel which played a major part of our experience during our stay.   \nThe hotel itself is perfectly placed to access the Old Town, The Harbour/Port  and the New Town all within easy walking distance  (or Taxi for the trip back ha!)\nWell done the 'Blue Sky Hotel'   and Jet2",

The pool is dirty & all sides of the pool troughs are thick with black slime. Nobody cleans or brushes it away. Full responsibility sits with the manager who clearly thinks that it us acceptable to have holiday makers sit around the focal point of the pool looking at the black sludge. \n\nBlack sludge does not just appear over a few days. I've seen other posts mention it too. The hot breakfast options are odd. Sweetcorn & peas, tomatoes with grated cheese, sliced up hotdog & boiled ham. Clearly the leftovers from the previous evening. Continental options are better. \n\nI would go again if Jet2.com guaranteed that the black pool slime was cleaned away. \n\n",
