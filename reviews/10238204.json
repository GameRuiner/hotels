      "text": "One of the best hotels I stayed in in ages. While it’s a four star hotel on paper, it’s really a five star plus hotel in terms of service and attention to detail.\n\nEverything you need for an excellent stay is graciously provided. Everyting looks and feels brand new. There is a flat plan android TV in your room. A small but very efficient fitness room with pretty much every equipment you may need downstairs.\n\nStaff is very attentive and professional.\n\nYou can easily access IZBAN (Izmir rail) and Izmir’s largest mall Optimum via a short 10 min walk from the hotel.",

The staff in all areas are always polite & welcoming with special thanks to Mrs Mehbare  who always ensures our stay is comfortable & nothing we require is too much trouble. I would also like to thank the Housekeeping staff especially ( Mrs Songul ) who kept our room spotless and the Hotel which was always very clean. The breakfast was always plentiful with a good selection & pleasant staff. \nThank you Mia & hope to see you soon.",
