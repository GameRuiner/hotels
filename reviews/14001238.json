      "text": "We stayed here for our honeymoon last year.  The hotel definitely had the wow factor as we walked through reception and through the sliding doors to admire the view across the sea.\n\nOur room was spotless, and as it was our honeymoon we treated ourselves to a swim up room.  In all honesty we didn't use the swim up pool that much we preferred the other pools so I probably wouldn't bother with that again, they also go in the shade come afternoon time.\n\nThe rooms were well equipped, a mini bar which was replenished daily and everything else you would expect.\n\nFood was beautiful everywhere we ate, and I think we tried them all!  All staff were just so helpful and friendly, I couldn't fault them.\n\nBar staff took orders and brought you drinks around the pool.  There was only one per pool when we were there last year and if I had any suggestions it would be to have more staff doing this as they work so hard to get round everybody.\n\nAs others have mentioned the beach is difficult to walk on with stones and pebbles but once in the sea its beautiful.  \n\nWe used beachbums to hire a boat for a couple of hours and would highly recommend.  We also walked a bit further down the boat and got the glass bottom boat one morning, again a good couple of hours out and would recommend.   \n\nThere is also a land train which picks you up just outside the hotel at the bus stop by the beach, this was brilliant to have a little trip around Kiotari at only about 7 euros I think.  You can get on and off at certain points.\n\nIt really is a stunningly beautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting.  The experience was marred for us however, as towards the end of our honeymoon the wild fires set in.  I found the way this was handled very disappointing.  In all honesty this would make me think twice about retuning here which is really sad as we had such an amazing time up till that point.  Sadly, we spent the last few days of our honeymoon in temporary accommodation, which wasn't how we expected our last days to pan out.",

The bed was huge!\n\nSeveral different restaurants on the resort, and every meal we had was lovely. Asian, Italian, Greek. The main restaurant was also fantastic with a vast selection of different foods to suit everyone, buffet style and also made fresh to order. There‚Äôs also a street food place where you can get snacks/coffees/icecreams/cakes.\n\nA minute walk from the beach (where we went every day). The sea is quite pebbly, but beach shoes sorted that. \n\nGenuinely can‚Äôt recommend this place enough. Will definitely be going back!",

      "text": "This hotel is exceptional. We had the best holiday here. Have been with my partner 11 years now and have been to several holiday destinations together but this has by far been our favourite holiday. The room was exquisite with a very comfortable bed and lovely walk in shower. We had a swim up pool with our room too. The food was amazing. 10/10! You can eat at the Greek, Italian and Asian restaurants as many times as you wish providing you book in advance. Everything was so delicious. The buffet restaurant was lovely as well. So much choice and everything very fresh. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were very accommodating. A highlight for me was the wine and champagne bar. Great to have a drink here before dinner and then wander into the Asian restaurant afterwards. The Asian restaurant was our favourite. There were 3 street food places to eat as well with everything cooked up fresh and the quality of the ingredients and food on offer was super. All alcoholic beverages were the brand names and waiter service around the pool. Can‚Äôt find any fault with this hotel.",

      "text": "We loved every single thing about the Mayia. We could not fault too much at all- only 1 - bathrooms not private enough- The arrival drinks and the concierge service was 5 star plus . Breakfast each morning was scrumptious and the beautiful scenery from the restaurant was stunning. You‚Äôd be hard pressed not to  find lots to your liking . Lunch was even better- we tried the Greek restaurant one lunch time but we loved the main restaurant so much that we ate there the rest of the holiday. Likewise with dinner- so much choice and the cleanliness and sheer size of the restaurant was amazing. The Asian was so nice too and the male waiter was very funny and attentive. The service by the pool was incredible- be that water or fabulous cocktails- top class service. The ice cream bar and coffee dock were such a nice treat. The classes were enjoyable and it was lovely to stroll down to the beach and be able to have a nice drink while enjoying the sound of the ocean.  The splendour of this resort is beyond words. We will definitely be returning again.",
