      "text": "On my 10 days recent  Dubai -Abidhabi trip , we stayed 2 days in this Raviz hotel . When we reached the hotel from Airport , its 11 PM Night . On my booking , i had written daughters age as 13-14 . But actual age was 15-17 . Seeing this , they asked me to book one extra room for 2 days . I had paid 11000Rs Extra for 1-2 yrs extra age gap . We dont have breakfast in our package . I told that we can manage in this family room . Even i asked to put an extra bed . Still they insist to book one room for 2 days . \n\nBut after that we stayed in Novotel Burdubai , Queens Elijabeth Cruise Hotel , Hilton Abudhabi , Howard Johnshon Dubai etc , noone asked for extra room booking . \n\nIts ramadan time , hotels are almost Blank . Still they charged us extra 11000Rs . \n\nSwimming pool is too small ...Indian restarurant is costly . So beware of this hotel . \n\nIn my 15 yrs travelling , never stayed in such hotels with Unethics extra charging .",

The water temperature for the shower is very hot even when we put the mixer all the way to the cold water side.\n\nTheir hospitality is great.
