      "text": "Had a lovely stay at Excelsior, good amenities and breakfast options. The location is bubbly and has great connections to local transport (donwtown to the souk or uptown to the mall) and the airport. The room was spacious and had all expected details - the temperature of the water was an issue that was quickly resolved. Staff are helpful and we had a wonderful member of the team Surjeet look after our room. Breakfast team staff are very helpful too. Srisha and Hasha deserve an honourable mention too. I would come back for sure. ",

      "text": "I and my group of companie's staff always stayed in the Excelsior Hotel downtown Dubai in the last year 2023. All the bookings were done 100%. The Hotel is very close to central Dubai. Amazing restaurants around the Hotel like the JusGrill In Al Rigga and a large shopping mall very close, like within walking distance. There is one negative manner the hotel is managed. The hotel staff is brilliant from when you enter the door to your room. Upon entering your room I can mention a few staff member's names, Syed, Jenny, Mustafa, Grisha, Umair, Zekoji, Ritesh, and Surjeet all these staff members are always very humble, respectful and helpful. They do all their work as professionals and proactively, what a pleasure to stay in a 4-star hotel with such a winning team. I think the manager Mr Amine Idraiouiche can be grateful for having this championing team with him. The Metro Bar is also an excellent hangout for beer, food and excellent entertainment, with Irene and Christine rocking the bar on time every time. As far as the food or kitchen goes, they need a better chef as the restaurants around the Hotel have amazing food. Their rates are not always the best, but the staff member like the names mentioned above make up for that with their amazing professionalism. I can only say good things about the hotel, but if they remove the staff my Group of Company's staff will look for a new hotel close by, the Excelsior Hotel to stay. So Mr Amine, please keep this amazing staff you have together otherwise, my group of companies will go and stay in a hotel close by. Trust this will help the Hotel Excelsior Down Town management to make the right choices in their staff handling.                   Greetings Dr Dean Visagi√©.   ",
