      "text": "Absolutely loved our stay at the Gateway - fantastic value in our really large family room. So big and also really clean with everything we needed, plus the free water every day was a nice touch.\n\nStaff were brilliant - very friendly and helpful with advice and arranging taxis for us - and checking everything was OK\n\nThe hotel is really close to the creek and also the souks.\n\nAs taxis are so cheap we used them to get around (roughly 35 Dirhams to Burj/Mall)\n\nThe breakfast was great - good variety of omelete/sausage/breads/fruits/pancakes and delicious fresh orange juice\n\nThe rooftop pool was really refreshing, plenty of room with beds and towels",

      "text": "Gateway review March 2-12\n\nWe now consider ourselves to be regulars at this hotel. \nHaving stayed in many of the high end hotels like Versace, Atlantis the Palm, Waldorf and Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, this is our favourite for many reasons. \nFriendly staff, ultra clean, good food, central area for transport and shopping. Great rooftop pool. \n\nAbu from Delhi on Security, Umam from Peshawar and John from Kenya and the others at the front entrance are all so helpful and friendly. Great for a chat and so kind. \nReception staff are amazing and so helpful , Prakash orders our take away food orders üëçüèΩ. \n\nDippin the manager is such a kind professional guy from Kerala who runs a great team, he kindly ensures I get a fabulous room to accommodate my mobility issue, many many thanks kind sir. \nIn the  pool it is Rishi who takes great care of us, a lovely young guy from Sri Lanka. \n\nThe restaurant staff are exemplary and genuine. Jyoti is so sweet and very knowledgeable for one so young, she gave me Jain food one morning at my request as I was curious. Ahmed and Khalid from Egypt are so kind and good mannered. They all make breakfast a delight. Minuka is a little treasure and all the staff are but I don‚Äôt know all the names yet. \nAs I‚Äôve previously said don‚Äôt be looking for balconies or views as there are none. It ticks all the boxes and makes a very pleasant stay. \nSee you all next month Inshallah.",
