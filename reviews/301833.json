      "text": "The reputation of the Sheraton and the house reef attracted us to the hotel, but we have been sorely disappointed.\n\nI’m currently staying at the Sheraton Sharm with my family. We checked in over the Easter weekend when the hotel was quiet. In recent days, the number of residents has increased, but throughout, the service, especially in the restaurants has been appalling. Having to chase staff for cutlery, waiting 5-10 mins at the omelette station even to be seen, ordering drinks multiple teams, only to have finished three courses before they arrive.\n\nI know Egypt isn’t know for its foods, The Sheraton has been one of the worst I’ve stayed at in Egypt in recent years.\n\nThe supposed snacks and food outside of the main restaurants are non-existent. Maybe the stale pastries in a box left over from breakfast available from the pool bar.\n\nIt’s not peak season, so I assume this is the reason for the slump and the hotel generally not being at its best, but I will not come back with the family.",

Starting from the bars and restaurant, both the chefs and the waiters are very careful of everyone’s needs and tastes. The food is great and changes every day, with international cuisine. The workers in reception are kind and available at any time. The cleaners of the rooms are cheerful and nice, not to mention their flawless way of setting the room every day. \nLastly, the animation is another masterpiece of the resort. They work hard and organise involving activities every day, from morning to night. You will have the opportunity to practice different sports and practices, always with music and joyful vibe. Every night there are different activities and shows for the guests, which are entertained all day long. \nI would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a relaxing yet fun and active holiday. 5 stars!!!",
