Especially the “Miami Vice!”\n\nThe breakfast was nice! \nI stayed here with my partner and we had a good time! The hotel is close to the Old town! Only 10/15 min walk away! \nThe beach is also 2 mins away!\n\nWe travelled here in the beginning of April, so it wasn’t the season and lots of places were closed. Unfortunately, the pool here was closed!",
