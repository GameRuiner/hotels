      "text": "Our family recently stayed for the third time at LEGOLAND® Hotel Dubai and had again a wonderful experience. The guest services team, especially Claussy and her team, were very attentive and welcoming, making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This time we visited during Ramadan and celebrated our daughter's 8th birthday. The staff went out of their way to ensure the celebration was special, which we greatly appreciated. Our room was comfortable and perfectly themed for a fun family stay. A big Thank you to Claussy and the team for making our visit memorable. We recommend LEGOLAND® Hotel Dubai to any family looking for a friendly and enjoyable stay during any time of the year.",

      "text": "An excellent place for a family staycation!  We took our 4 year old son here and he had such a wonderful time.   From the lobby full of lego blocks, to the excellent pool and the themed room - it's a great place to take your kids.\n\nOur Ninjago room was vibrantly designed with lots of colours and even a treasurehunt, where we had to work out the combination to open a safe which contained a surprise inside!\n\nThe stay may seem expensive, but the fact you get access to the theme park or water park for each night you stay, makes it worth it.  We chose the theme park and really enjoyed it.  It was open from 11am-7pm and the fact we could re-enter was perfect for day naps.  The hotel is just 2 mins walk from the theme park.\n\nWith regards to souvenirs, Lego can be costly so we appreciated how the shop had lots of little bags and value items that could be purchased with pocket money.\n\nThe staff are so friendly too and the restaurant buffet was good.",
