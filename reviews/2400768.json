      "text": "We came to Voco Monaco as part of a birthday celebration. From start to finish it had been fantastic. The transfer by boat from the canal is a great way to start the vacation.\nThe staff are fantastic and will assist in any way they can.\nIt was very quiet during the weekend we stayed and while it’s marketed as a party hotel with 24hr pool access, non stop pay music from afternoon until early hours of the morning, it certainly is a party place. It was just a shame that it was so quiet here. There were just two of us at the swim up pool bar last night.\nThe pool is the biggest open air pool in the region and offers plenty of sun beds, chairs and side tables to enjoy the pool anytime of day or night.\nThe beach is really nice, with big double sun-beds to relax overlooking the sea with only the few scattered islands to spoil your view, if you can call it spoiling your view that is. It’s mega!!!\n\nBreakfast is included at the buffet restaurant and the manager Sahid and g his team of waiters and chefs will certainly not disappoint.\n\nFor me it was a great experience to enjoy in the quiet time what will be a very popular destination for a party.",

If you want to have an amazing time, make sure to visit there at least once! \n\nThe cleanliness and smell was just amazing!\nTowels, its detergent such as shampoo, shower gel  and the body lotion all smell like heaven! The room was always clean thanks to the housekeepers Kamlesh and Maylin \n\nFriendly personnel and staff, they will accommodate guests pleasantly and welcoming.\n\nDelicious foods and they’re designed internationally like a top-rated restaurant.\nSahid , Zakriya , Veronica and Warda will serve you the food with respect.\n\nGood vibes around the hotel, playing music daylong \nAmenities are so entertaining, ping pong, and water sports  \nSwimming pool, There are different kinds of tubs in the pool in which you can get tanned while you drinking your cocktail! \nBeach bars are amazing and the bartenders are pretty qualified to serve you the best cocktails\nThe Internet access is just awesome.\n\nLooking forward to coming back there.",
