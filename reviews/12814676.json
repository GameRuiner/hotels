      "text": "My partner and I have just returned from a 4 day stay in this hotel. \nWe chose the hotel based on the reviews , the location and the photos ....we shouldn't have done this. \nCheck in time is 14.00 but we had to wait till 15.00 because the guests hadn't left our room yet and the staff were most laxadasical in their efforts in getting them to leave. \nWe had booked the loft because of the balcony with a city view and the promise of a 45 sq m room. My expectations were dashed when the room was half that size and the view was of a factory 50 m away and was active 24/7. It was disturbingly loud. \nWe confronted the reception about this loud factory and were promised a different room the following day. The next morning we were then told that this free room didn't actually exist as all rooms were full. \nThe bathroom was roomy with a nice shower but seriously , do I want frayed towels with huge holes in them ? No, I certainly do not. Neither do I want a bed quilt with smears of blood and other disgusting liquids in it. The sheets were also frayed and holey in keeping with the towels . \nThe hotel claims to be in the desirable Konak area, it's not ...it's in a scruffy part of Izmir about a 20 minute walk from Konak. \nThe breakfast is simple but totally adequate. The staff were friendly but unprofessional. \nWould I stay here again? Most certainly not.",
