      "text": "First off, this hotel is located in one of the dodgiest areas you will ever see in your life.  The kind of area where you could easily be robbed and murdered for pennies.  Very scary location. Would not even want to pop to corner shop there.\n\nRooms in photos are nothing like the one I was forgiven.  I have never been in a more dirty, disgusting and dangerous looking room in my entire life.  Yellow stained everywhere, some kind of sheet drooping from the ceiling, a prison cell or a dog kennel look more comfortable.  Big poo stains in the loo (whole bathroom looked horrific), there was even some rotten fruit in the fridge!  It stunk.  I was so depressed, I would likely be suicidal if I dared stay the night.  I tried to film it, to show the absolute horror, but i was shaking so much I somehow didn't save it.  I was booked for four nights, but I checked in and checked right out again in under 5 minutes.  Now staying in one 1000 x better, both in area and hotel.  I feel so much safer and comfortable.  Trying to get refund now after all of the trauma, and it really was a traumatic experience, but it's like trying to get blood from a stone.  \n\nPlease don't put yourself through it, it was a hellscape, and a place like this should not be operating.",

The street is a bit dirty, but this is the historical part, so it cannot be changed. We can recommend this hotel - for this price it's a good choice.",
