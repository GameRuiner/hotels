If they’re not within walking distance you can get the metro which is easy to use once you get the hang of it I\nIt’s easy to get to by shuttle bus from the airport, just get off at Catalunya metro station.\nThe staff were very friendly and the room was very clean with a very nice bathroom and gave us everything we needed.\n\nBreakfast was a bit pricey so we just walked to a Starbucks 2 minutes away \n\nFor the location we thought the nightly rate was reasonably \nCheck out the Tapas bar Tracatra next door, food was excellent but you might have to book a table \n\nSo we would definitely recommend the hotel for a stay in Barcelona",
