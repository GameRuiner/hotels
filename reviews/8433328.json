      "text": "I stayed for a week at Casa Cook with my husband. Similarly to other people I am sure, I was a bit worried about visiting the island so soon after the devastating fires that Rhodes had experienced.  This turned out to be completely unnecessary, as almost the entire island was already back to business by the time we arrived. Not only that, aside from a swathe of burnt trees in the southwestern part of Rhodes, you couldn't evens see that there had been a fire, which I found remarkable. The hotel itself is gorgeous and secluded. The landscape of pines and rocks is very dramatic, I could look at it all day. I really liked the modern-yet-warm atmosphere of the hotel layout, and the fact that water plays a big role in the decor, with long thin pools everywhere to offset the aridity of the landscape.  Our suite with private pool was really lovely, and worth it to reserve. It was enormous (but I feel like most of the rooms at Casa Cook are spacious, which is a good thing), and equipped with everything a holiday-maker needs. We arrived to a large platter of fruits and Greek goodies, which I personally loved as we were able to snack on these for almost our entire stay. Yum! There was also a bottle of champagne in our room, thank you for this as well!  The bed is VERY comfortable, and for once the pillows were perfect. I did not have to ask for a neck supportive pillow, which I really appreciated.  The layout of the room is also great, the sofa could be a bit bigger or more comfortable, but we were out so much of the time that this was unimportant. Wifi very good as well, for those WFH folks. The hairdryer was perfect; the toiletries were GREAT; the pool is not heated so be aware of this. It was still very very warm outdoors in September (great time to go in fact), but I found the sea to be much nicer in terms of temperature - having said that I did get my Instagrams in :). The food is very very good. I read other reviews that suggested it was not, but the breakfast buffet is endless and delicious, and my husband and I ate in-house almost every night. The menu is not rotated so it can get a bit boring for the food adventurous, but we really liked it. My favorite thing was watching the other guests, I appreciated so much that people took an effort with appearance; I also saw that Casa Cook attracts a variety of ages - I was worried we would be on the too old side to enjoy it here, but there were all ages, older teens until over 70's. Also, I really loved the music, I am a lounge/chill enthusiast so this was perfect for me. We had two massages each at the spa, and this also deserves a special recommendation - they were incredible. Thank you! The people who worked at the hotel were mainly amazing, I only felt a bit apprehensive at reception. For some reason, the ladies and gentlemen who worked there seemed a bit cold and not very helpful. For example, I was hoping to book a private driver for our stay but the front desk had no recommendations and no idea how to go about finding someone. It also felt more in the vein of a Gen Zer who was like, \" but why would you want to do that just rent a car\" (for those who do wish to rent, there is a dedicated desk just outside reception that handles rentals and they were doing a booming business the week we were in residence).  I did find a wonderful company to help me out and we had a great week, but I had to organize this on my own and sift companies etc. The communal pools I can't comment on, but they were full every day. The area feels remote, but it is well placed on the (Huge!), island of Rhodes. You can easily get anywhere in a rental, and it is totally worth going into the Old Town to see the medieval city. All in all, I would say that I really really enjoyed our stay here, and I would definitely come back again. I wish everyone could experience a holiday that is classy, relaxing, beautiful and warm/welcoming without having to pay an arm and a leg for it. That is my last comment - Thank You so very much for not charging the earth. This is pretty much the only place I have ever been where I could leave with money in my wallet but still have beautiful memories of a week well enjoyed.  ",
