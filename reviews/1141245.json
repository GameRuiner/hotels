      "text": "The staff at the hotel were brilliant and couldn’t do enough to make our stay perfect, we were literally treated like royalty, they went above and beyond. Our room was quite a traditional Egyptian furnished style room, a little dated but it was kept lovely and clean, was very comfortable and very spacious with beautiful views of the pools, gardens and beach. The air conditioning in the room was great. The cleaner changed our towels and made the beds everyday and often left us towel displays. Mini shampoos, shower gels and soaps were restocked in our bathroom daily. There was always a huge variety of food available here, with something for everyone, unless you’re a ridiculously picky/fussy person. The a-le-carte restaurants were fab, the food in the Italian and Lebanese was just delicious. The Italian was a big favorite of ours, the meals were so tasty, give them a try you won’t regret it. The animation and entertainment was good and aqua park/pools were great fun and kept clean. Our 5 year old daughter had so much fun here. The gardens around the hotel were beautiful and well maintained. The beach was great, you could enjoy the sandy beach, and the corals in the sea are amazing. There were always plenty of sun-beds available around the hotel. Drinks were nice with a some variety.  Ice creams  were available in the afternoons which was great and slushies down at the swim up pool bar were nice. The only thing I would suggest is there needs to be a bar for basic drinks and snacks down at the beach. The location of the hotel is near shops and restaurant's if you wish to venture outside. Me and my family will definitely return to this hotel we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. As stated above the staff go above and beyond to make you feel so welcome and they work tirelessly and always have a smile on their faces. Thank you to all the staff at rehana for a great stay. Hope to see you all again very soon. :)",

The wall in the bathroom was moldy, the toilet bowl was always running. The sheets and duvet covers were stained. 5 stars for black. The alcoholic drinks were very weak. They put soda water or sprite instead of Sweps. We also booked restaurant seats at the reception, very slow service, we waited 30 minutes for drinks and 40-60 minutes for food. The food was poor. The same food every day in the restaurant. The New Year's feast was big and there was an incredible selection of sweets. The cookies were the best.\nSince we had a night flight, we asked to extend the room, but we were told that we had to pay 23 dollars per person. There were three of us and we gave up. kiid said that the room can be extended for free, but the hotel refused.",
