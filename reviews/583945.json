      "text": "The administration is VERY helpful and any request made - for towels, iron, washroom tissue - is responded to IMMEDIATELY, and with TRENDOUS respect by the hotel employees. The set up is most elegant, and the place is very centrally located - near a major metro station, hundreds of good restaurants with a vast price range, and great shopping.\n\nI'm sure the hotel's restaurants are excellent as well - I m sorry for not being able to eat, but, having got the aroma, I can only hope to recover my health before I leave.\n\nA REAL gem of a hotel in Bur Dubai.",

      "text": "I don’t recommend. Never have I ever felt so uncomfortable in a hotel as a solo guest. \nAs a female solo guest, I had a room that had an adjoining door to the next room (it was locked but that doesn’t stop anyone breaking in).\n\nConstant noise throughout the night with the lift going, guests coming and going, talking loudly at all hours of the night in the hall way with no regard for other guests in their room sleeping.\n\nEarly one morning the phone in my room rings once and hangs up, another morning at 5.45am someone is ringing my door bell. When I get up, no one was there. I felt so uncomfortable and unsafe\n\nThe bed itself was surprising comfortable however that aside, the room itself feels old and dirty. The bathroom sink has mould around it, the bath/shower has old grime on the base. The towel rack is about to fall off the wall.\n\nThe 2 chairs in the room are old and dirty and there is an old Aladdin’s magic carpet in there that hasn’t been cleaned in who knows how long. I felt sick even just stepping on it. It serves no purpose in the room.\n\nI would never stay here again",

      "text": "I must say that for a price of around ₹6,000/- (AED 270)  per night during the peak season, this hotel is a very value for money proposition. We stayed there from 26th November to 1st December 2022 which is within the peak season of tourism in Dubai. Unlike some other reviews, we found the service of the hotel to be very nice. Every time we had a concern, the hotel staff were prompt in resolving them. \n\nThe amenities inside each room include a washing machine; ironing board; hair dryer; bath tub; kitchenette (with crockery, cutlery, microwave oven, induction burners, electric kettle and an exhaust chimney) and room temperature control.\n\nThere’s buffet breakfast which was decent enough. There’s also a swimming pool and gym but we didn’t have time for those.\n\nTip: if you are there with a large group of 8 or more people, I suggest you avail their cab service. There’s this one driver named ‘Faisal’ who drives a Toyota HiAce and was very helpful throughout our trip. Also, the car was very comfortable, spacious and much more cost effective than hiring two taxis.",
