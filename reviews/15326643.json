      "text": "by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed at,  this hotel claims to be a 5 star accommodation i would say more like a 3 star at a push. \n\nI would like to start by repeating the complaints we initially made during our stay.\nWe arrived at Stella on the 26th of March in our first room we experienced dirt on the carpet and bed along with mold in the shower, as well as a half broken toilet seat that was slanted. We stayed our first night and first thing when we woke up on the 27th we complained to the front desk who then told us we would be moved to a new room. Upon arrival back to Stella at 6:30 pm we went to see our second room which was identical to our first. This room also had mold in the shower and was not up to 5 star standards which we expected when booking this through booking.com as you advertise yourself as a 5star accommodation.  We then called down to the reception to request a refund for the 3 more nights we were due to stay so we could checkout and find alternative  hotel. We where told that we could only receive a refund for 2 nights as we had complained past 6:30pm upon returning from our day out (something which we where not told by the receptionist who moved us to this room earlier in the day). So at this point we were happy to LEAVE Stella di mare - we did not want further upgrades. YOUR general manager then called us back 5 minutes later and told us she would move us to a top floor suit. We packed up for the 2nd time and moved to the new room. We unpacked and went out. Upon arrival back to the hotel at 11:30pm we arrived to our room to find a night club above our heads with banging music. We made 3 noise complaints for over an hour over the phone and it took us going down to the hotel lobby in person and then  requesting the manager to visit our room to be taken seriously. At this point it was 1am and we had to pack up for a 3rd time to move to room 2404, which was our 4th room of the trip. \nThis room was better. It was not moldy and did not have a night club above our heads however something that we did not complain about until we left the hotel was the hair shavings we saw on the side of the shower which I showed you during our meeting when we checked out. \n\nDuring all of this on the 28th after we arrived back to the hotel we received a call from the manager who offered us free dinner for the last 2 nights of our stay. We explained that we had already eaten and had booking reservations for the night after. On this phone call I was categorical told I would not have to pay for the first 2 nights stay of this 4 night holiday. I was told that ‚Äúif I had booked and paid through the front desk I could come down and get a refund no problem‚Äù ‚Äúbut as I had booked through booking.com I would need to contact them to get them to reach out and request a refund on our behalf‚Äù this is what we did. To then later find out that Stella di mare would refuse to providing written confirmation to booking.com explaining they had promised us a refund for our troubles. I am extremely frustrated at this and how we have been lied to. the hotel lied to us and lied to booking.com. I was told we would not have to pay for the first 2 nights and that we would get 50% reduction on our stay. \n\nplease avoid at all costs!!!",
