Just minutes walk away from Las ramblas.\nBreakfast was really nice good selection, all fresh and lots of choice. We didn't try any evening meals or the bar as there's so many restaurants and bars in the city centre. \nRoom was perfect we were a family of 4 and it was really spacious with a balcony. \nRoom was spotless and was cleaned everyday. \nStaff were really friendly and so helpful with directions when we asked. Check in and check out was efficient.\nWould recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay again 100%.",
