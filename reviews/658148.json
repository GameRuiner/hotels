      "text": "The grounds of this hotel are kept immaculate the gardeners work very hard and it has paid off, the rooms are very big and has everything you need in it, our cleaner was fantastic and did a wonderful job. The restaurant was very good with lots of choice and food was hot, the Italian and Lebanese restaurants were fantastic. The pool barman was miserable most of the time and hardly crack a smile, we did however venture over to the aqua charmillion where the pool guy was fantastic and it was bottled beer rather than local. The animation team were good when they got going but took them 3 days to really come and talk to us. On our first day the salesmen were relentless and didn’t leave us alone when we just wanted to acclimatise and get used to our surroundings, you just have to be firm and say no thank you. The beach is lovely and great if you want to snorkel. If you want a taxi go outside the front gates there are plenty waiting, we paid £20 a return to old market town, where the hotel wanted £45. The hotel is 80% Russian guests, we didn’t have a problem with them but to the staff who work very hard they are very rude too  and it’s hard to watch, manners cost nothing. As for the building work, you can hear the odd drilling noise around the pool but nothing that ruins your holiday and hardly noticeable to be fair. I wouldn’t say this is a 5 star and we have we previously at 4 stars in sharm which were better. If you fancy a meal out we went to pizza Melodie’s, in old market town which is out of this world, we go to this restaurant every time we go to sharm, the fillet steak melts in your mouth. 8 of us ate and drank(soft drinks) for £115, they also provided us with a amazing cake as it was a special birthday and decorated around our table.",

      "text": "Booked for one week with all inclusive service I was impressed by the attitude of the employee. Very good service, with special compliments to the restaurant manager who is putting efforts together in order to make the quests be satisfy.\nA big plus is the diversity of the food (options for special needs are available) the complex is very well kept, room ok, a la carte restaurants available for 2 books. Some of them located in the others hotels from the big complex. Club resort guests with all inclusive service can use facilities from another hotels.\nThe entertainment team quite active, shows and activities during the day.\nRegarding the lobby bat some evenings with non alcoholic smoothie s but alcoholic drinks aren't what they are suppose to be, even if is local. The hotel has also a farmacy, ATM machine and some shopping center. The prices are bigger than normal shopping area.,\nDifferent pools for kids and adults, the beach has sunbeds, also an area for snorkeling.\nI highly recommend this hotel.",

The staff are good and polite,and food is good. The rooms are big clean and comfortable, however the bathroom could be updated. The pool is good, the surrounding areas can be slightly slippery, however signs are placed. The pool staff don’t miss anything, and take safety very seriously, with chlorine checks and the no jumping rules enforced. \nGuests are from all nations, with many  woman displaying various forms of poor cosmetic surgery, ranging from a top lip so firm , Daffy Duck would of been proud, to cheeks so raised, the women walk around looking like they have just left the dentist after 4 hours of route canal work.\nThe beach is beautiful, and the resort is well maintained. \nI did witness some guests being very rude to staff, clearly forgetting their manners, however staff remained professional.\nI would book again, as this has been a very pleasant and comfortable stay , and I couldn’t have asked for more.",

      "text": "A wonderful hotel where the staff really do go out of their way to treat you like a valued guest. The room was a bit dated but some rooms were being revamped while we were there so the hotel is taking steps to freshen it up. The food was good, fresh and mostly the same each day although they did have themed nights. The Ala-Carte restaurants were very good and the Terryaki restaurant was superb. The only minor niggle is the sales reps every day selling you tours, boat trips, snorkelling and the spa/salon. A few repeated no’s however, did get the message across. There is a slight expectation of tips as well but if you don’t tip there isn’t any offence. But, tipping the waiting staff did ensure you had a table with drinks already waiting for you and they were very attentive and willing to please. It is too far to walk into town so a taxi is necessary. Hotel taxis are dearer than if you walk outside the resort and use the ones waiting there. Take some decent mosquito spray with you and take some varied money with you as most places accept US dollar, English pound, Euro, Egyptian pound. Temperature was around 24-29c from 09/03/24.",
