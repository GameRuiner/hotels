      "text": "A totally underwhelming experience.  A very noisy fridge revealed the item hardwired into the mains socket with no fuse at all.  Insulation was cracked and blackened.  Reported this and an 'engineer' came to my room.  The reason for the absence of a plug is to ensure the cupboard door shuts!  He also told me they were all like that!  Dangerous.  The hotel also could not cope with numbers at breakfast and repeatedly made mistakes in assigning tables that were already taken leaving customers in limbo.  The pool area closed at 8pm when life in Dubai is just getting started.  The food at breakfast was distinctly average and they kept running out of cups, bowls, milk and so on.  Totally chaotic.  The only saving grace was it's location in Al Barsha, albeit surrounded by massage parlors!  Avoid",

The smell of smoke absolutely hitting you when getting out the lift was something else, are make shift room was dirty and two bugs on the floor also a double bed for three of us to share. \n\nI went back up to reception and explained how there was three of us to one double bed to share and how the room was dirty another 10mins of blaming each other later they sent another single\nBed down and did nothing about cleaning the room, so I went back up to reception and marched one of the lovely gentlemen down to show them the room and explained we will have our money back and find another hotel as this is totally unacceptable. \n\nThey finally moved us to a slightly better room and when i say slightly I mean slightly (non smoking level) \n\nIn a nutshell I wouldn‚Äôt listen to the reviews on here as they make this hotel sound a lot better than it actually is.",
