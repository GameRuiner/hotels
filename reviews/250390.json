      "text": "The hotel and rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The location of the hotel is perfect, very accessible and walkable to many sites and attractions. Also, very convenient to restaurants as well.\nThe downside of our experience was our rooms were extremely hot and there was no way to cool them down. We asked for assistance and were told to open the window, which allowed bugs to come in making sleeping difficult. Also, one of our rooms opened to a balcony this was an unsafe environment as sleeping with the balcony window open could allow intruders to enter. When I said this to the front desk, they told me just keep it open. Wow we were awake and use a fan.",

When you enter  you get into a spacious historical lobby with bits of different styles and above it there is a beautiful gallery with a glass pyramid top, that serves as a breakfast area. The variety of breakfast was satisfying.\nThe room was big enough with ample storage capacity in the wardrobe. If your room is not on the front, it has miserable view, but at least it's quiet, you don't hear the buzz of the high street.\nWe were satisfied with the job of the maids.\nAs we arrived early we could leave our suitcase at reception and upon leaving early morning, we got packed breakfast.\nThe hotel offered a pick up service from airport which was convenient.",
