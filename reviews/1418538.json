      "text": "My stay this time was in late October just before the closure. Weather was balmy and the water of the sea and the pool warm. I am grateful to Vasilis and Katerina who upgraded me to the best possible accommodation and meals scheme. I was spoiled this time with the best view, the best food and the best drinks and as always with the warmest and genuine hospitality. It was so good to see again Fotis, Ivan and Despina in the reception, Enias the hotel manager, Marilena in the mini market and Silvia in the clothes shop. As I mostly stayed inside the hotel this time I relaxed deeply to the point I almost forgot how the real world looks like. I cannot wait to come again to see the moon rising in 2024.\n",

      "text": "This year was the third time that my daughter and I have stayed at this wonderful hotel. We visited at the end of July to the beginning of August. \nThis year the hotel and the rest of Rhodes faced huge challenges with the unfortunate wild fires which swept through the island while we were there. Never the less the hotel staff coped admirably and we still had a wonderful holiday despite us both falling ill after eating a bad meal at the Asia restaurant.\nAll of the staff at the hotel are amazing but I would like to give very special thanks to Jani the Manager of pool restaurant who is one the most friendly and helpful people you could ever hope to meet along with his waiter Vladimir, Voula who is fabulous and always gives us the most friendly smile and welcome, The amazing manager at the main buffet restaurant, Vangelis the Chef, all of the beach bar and main bar staff and the hotel manager.\nAnother MASSIVE thank you must go to Katerina the amazing Operations Manager. We had huge problems getting to the hotel due to the fires but Katerina extremely kindly went above and beyond to make sure we got a room at a sister hotel for the night when the road was blocked by fire. Unfortunately Katerina is no longer based at the Atrium Prestige which is a huge pity as with her there it always feels like our home away from home. Without her there it is still a great hotel but no longer quite feels like home.",

The Greek restaurant by the beach is also excellent. We first discovered the hotel by chance when we went on a trip and wanted to see it. They welcomed us very kindly at the reception and that was the reason why the hotel was our choice from then on. Everyone at the hotel is always and always pleasant. We always choose all inclusive, but it is also possible to choose other alternatives. You ultimately pay for what you order at the reception, so you don't have to carry money even with an option other than all.",
