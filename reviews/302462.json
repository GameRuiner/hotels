      "text": "Amazing stay at JBH as a family of 5.  Gorgeous setting, facilities and lots of lovely restaurants to choose from. \nThe kids club is the best.  Something for all ages.  Achini looked after our 1 year old and ensured he was happy and settled.  Our older children loved playing there too.  A really warm, friendly and fun team. \nHasib met us everyday at the exec pool always with a smile and chat.  Kawser looked after us around the pool and took excellent care of us ensuring we always had everything we needed. \nHousekeeping was exceptional.  Our room was always clean and tidy.  \nThe only downside was the building work taking place so our balcony was often dusty, there wasn’t a great view and we could often hear building work at bedtime.  Would recommend a room on the water park side in the meantime.",

      "text": "I stayed here as a treat with my wife and kids to get away from the rain, rain, rain in England after a long hard winter!\n\nThe hotel is really lovely, and the pools and beach are worth the visit. We stayed at peak time (not an empty room in the place, and heaving inside) but we never failed to get pool chairs or chairs at the beach. The pool and the beach are second to none, and the staff were terrific - both at the pool and in the arrivals area in front of the hotel.\n\nThe gym (J Club) is excellent - plenty of space and open 24 hours. \n\nWe really had a great time here and it set us up to cheerfully go back and face rainy England, but we marked this place down a star because, at times, it’s all a bit mystifying. We didn’t get much explanation for how the hotel worked when we checked in (pro tip, look for all the QR codes), and it’s big enough to get around that it’s easy to miss a lot of what it has to offer. \n\nAlso we arrived at the hotel at 10am and there was no room free to go into until 3pm - not a problem in itself in peak season, but the person at check in kind of strung us along saying a room would be free as soon as possible (so we ended up sitting around for at least five hours) when it probably would have been better to just level with us that it would be 3pm so we could go do something else for a while.",

Nasir and his colleagues at the Executive Pool were super attentive and very friendly always making sure we had everything we needed by the pool. Shsad and the team at the club lounge were so friendly and made us feel really welcome, taking so good care of us. And a big thank you to Sayed and Bishwa from housekeeping for keeping our room clean and tidy the whole time. They were incredibly attentive and made us feel at home. Every day they surprised us with a very cute animal made out of towels on our bed, so creative! If you’re heading to Dubai, We totally recommend staying at Jumeirah Beach Hotel.

BEWARE!\n\nThey state it is an issue with international bank payments but this is not the case as we stayed at the Atlantis after the Jumeriah Beach Hotel and we have received our ‘holding fee’ back from them already.\n\nThe hotel has also not acknowledged our email requesting the refund be debited back into our account.\n\nIt appears from the reviews we are not the only customers that have experienced this ‘fraudulent’ behaviour!!\n\nI would suggest staying at an alternative hotel.",
