Spacious and well cooled rooms at just the right temperature (considering the 40 celsius summer heat in Izmir), helpful staff and wonderful amenities.

Short taxi ride to local sights.\nHotel staff were so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing - fruits, greens, scrambled eggs etc, etc. Loved the room - spacious for the 2 of us. Bathroom lighting a tad dim for shaving but no problem. Locals are friendly and many spoke English. I learned a few simple Turkish words before we arrived. Izmir is awesome.",
