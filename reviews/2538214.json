      "text": "We stayed here for four nights in July. We would definitely consider staying here again. It wasn't cheap (considering the distance from the city centre), but it had air conditioning, and the location was excellent - steps from the metro, and in a safe and relatively quiet area.\n\nThe bed was reasonably comfortable and the pillows were decent. The room had a balcony, which we didn't even notice until the second day. No mini-fridge, unfortunately. Only one lift for the entire hotel so be prepared to wait.\n\nThe front desk staff were friendly and spoke English quite well. One very strange thing about this hotel was that they forced you to give them the room key anytime you left the premises. Perhaps they've had bad luck with lost keys, I don't know. We didn't mind, but I can't say I've ever experienced that before. \n\nI don't know whether this hotel offers a breakfast, as we didn't ask. The TV worked, but did not seem to have cable. We had brought our firestick to plug it in to get Netflix and such, but there was only one power outlet within reach of the TV, and that was needed for the TV. So that wasn't an option. And the Internet did not function at all on the TV, so using that interface didn't work either. We wound up watching TV on our laptop. \n\nThe washroom was fine, cozy but functional. No laundry in this hotel but there's a laundromat a five-minute walk away.\n\nAll in all, a good stay.",

Ratio of shared bathrooms to rooms / occupancy seems about 12 rooms per wc. Enjoy the lack of toijet paper, odours and items left in the shower room. First night, of three unfortunately, the lift broke down until next  morning. Almost useless thin towels provided. Inadequate staff, especially at night  to deal with noisy clients. A positive? Some reception staff were sympathetic. Not their fault. This structure is flawed. Even street noise is remarkable on the 3rd floor. In general  complaints were accepted with a knowing \" well it's like this\". The location is useful for metro and the local eating is good. The bar next door is accommodating and well used to sympathising with hostel clients!
