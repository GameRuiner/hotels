      "text": "The apartment was spectacular and everyone was very friendly and courteous. However - for the price that we paid (over 40,000dhs) there should be (at least) twice weekly cleaning and bed changing provided - in fact there should be daily servicing.\n\nWe found the service to be a bit hit-or-miss. On some days when we called down to take the trash out or for new towels/sheets we got service within 10 minutes and on other occasions it took hours with call backs required. On one occasion we had to leave after waiting over an hour for somebody to come, so I placed the refuse bag outside the door. We were severely (almost rudely) admonished for doing this.\n\nThe beds were very comfortable but the furniture in the main living/dining area was both sparse and very poor quality.\n\nI was also a bit disappointed to get a call at 11:05 on the morning of departure putting us under pressure to vacate the apartment immediately on the premise that \"the next guests had paid for early check-in\".\n\nBeautiful apartments in a wonderful location but the overall product does not justify the cost.",

      "text": "I stayed in their coveted 5-BR apartment, which is absolutely amazing.  I didn't need all of those bedrooms, but I appreciated the penthouse feel.  These are serviced apartments, so you won't get the full hotel experience...but the good thing about these apartments in particular was that it shared the lobby with the Rixos hotel, and thus access to bars, restaurants, excursions, etc...was at your fingertips.  The team was also incredibly responsive.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the room could use some updates/modernization, particularly to the kitchen and bathrooms.  Still, if I could have bought this apartment, I would have!   Very nice.",
