      "text": "Superb location, great access to walk to all the great sites to see and cafes/restaurants to eat in. Friendly helpful staff especially the bar and restaurant staff (we ate in the hotel restaurant twice). The bedroom is a great size, with an extremely comfortable bed, fridge, hairdryer and kept clean with great furnishings in keeping with the whole hotel. We stayed from Saturday 23 to Friday 29 March in a room on the 4th floor. The hotel has great sound proofing from the outside hustle and bustle and guests aren't too noisy down the corridors. We could feel the trains underground. There is a wonderful view from the rooftop and normally there would be another restaurant but it was closed, however you could order drinks. NOTE: the pool on the rooftop and in the spa area are currently closed due to a government request to preserve water. This doesn't just impact the hotel - it's all over Barcelona! You'll signs everywhere explaining why water fountains / features are currently empty. You can use the sauna and steam room for 30 minutes that needs to be pre-booked and there is a gym for use - we didn't end up using either there was too much to do. There is also in the Reception area between 16:00 and 18:00 an opportunity to have tea, coffee, biscuits and sandwiches. We only did this once as there is a very strong flora smell in the Reception area which I personally found quite overpowering for my senses. Overall a beautiful hotel which we enjoyed staying in. Thank you very much.",

Upon arrival we were given free drink on the roof top bar while are bags where sent to our room. The room was big and clean and very comfortable bed. We ate in the restaurant 3 nights of our 4 nights there the food was delicious and the staff well not enough could he said about the staff. The Breakfast was good to we ate there everyday to and the breakfast team where supper to. The only fault I had with this hotel and nothing to do with them really was the pools were closed. I will be back to Barcelona and I will be staying here again. From my family to your establishment thank you for a wonderful week and your hospitality and the love shown to my little girl not one member of staff walked by her without saying hello or engaging with her.",
