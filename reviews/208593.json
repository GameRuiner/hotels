And I guess the other guests will appreciate as well.",

The staff were very friendly and helpful. \nBreakfast was basic, but adequate. The only thing I have to complain about is the coffee, it was terrible. Could also do with coffee and tea making facilities in the room. The hotel is very well situated for everything.",

      "text": "Hotel California Barcelona is in the middle of the Gothic quarter , perfect location for restaurants and an easy walk to the Harbour area. This hotel is boutique in style with a little but quaint  lobby. Rooms are  small, not much larger than a double bed but the bathrooms are beautiful with white marble  and a floor to ceiling  terrace window , mine had a large bathtub. The best part was the breakfast , a decently expansive buffet with meat, cheese and pastries plus coffee and juices served over generous time frame. Beds are on the hard side , not much top padding.  Still, I'd highly recommend this place, very good value for the price you pay .",

      "text": "Not even close to a 3 star hotel.  The man who checked us in was by far the worst customer service we experienced in Barcelona.  Our room was not ready (which was anticipated), but our bags were pushed behind the desk (by me as he didn't even get up) and no security over our bags existed.  I ended up carrying my computer bag all day since I didn't trust the security.  The room was pathetic.  Hasn't been updated in probably 30 years and the room had a smell that could not be avoided.  Given all the hotels in the area, I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me.   We ended up leaving after being in the room for 10 minutes max and the guy behind the desk shouted \"no refunds\" when I asked.   Find another place.  ",
