(I am not sure if it was extra quiet due to the month of ramadan).\nThe grounds are beautiful and spotless -and  its much bigger than the pictures online show. \nI can't fault anything in my personal experience.\nFrom the moment we arrived the staff were excellent, in particular i want to highlight Sam on the front desk who was always professional yet personsble and willing to help or offer advice on any thing - I did find the bed a bit hard for my taste and he has the hotel very quickly added a topper and extra duvet.\nOlivia in guest relations always made sure to check in with us and to make sure we were enjoying our stay.\nFood was great.\nBeach was great - the water is incredible..\nThe spa is fabulous too, we did a hamam x massage treatment and be sure to ask for Esra if you want a strong and firm massage. She was soooo good!!!\nI didn't want to do a full tour day so\nWe took a private short boat trip from the hotel to do some snorkeling and it was a highlight!\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this resort ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ˜€",

Our room number was 169, a family suite on the ground floor with a terrace overlooking the pool and the sea.\n\nOur room cleaner was very intensive, he took a real pride in his cleaning work with nothing too much trouble.\n\nAll of the restaurant staff are extremely helpful and very, very friendly. We ate in every restaurant, but we all agreed our favourite was the Mexican inspired restaurant, absolutely top quality food. In second place was the Egyptian restaurant, again, superb quality food. \n\nAll staff at the front of house, concierge and bar staff are very polite and very helpful.\n\nThe buffet food quality is excellent, we ate in there two nights out of the seven. Lunch at the seafood Grill next to the beach with amazing views, I can highly recommend the beef medallion\n\nThe alcoholic drink selection is pretty good, I mostly stuck to red wine in the evening, I would mark this 8 out of 10 \n\nMost evenings, we would sit in the lounge area next to the reception with a live pianist playing while sipping a cocktail, so relaxing and so quiet.\n\nUnfortunately, one week before we arrived, I had emergency hand surgery which meant I could not swim in the pool of the sea, but nonetheless a week of amazing rest and great sleep .\n\nWeâ€™ve stayed at a lot of nice hotels around the world and Baron Palace definitely is up there with one of those nice hotels. Will we return? Absolutely. Hopefully we shall visit again this summer to enjoy some swimming.",
