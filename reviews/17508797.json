      "text": "Excellent hotel. Close to centre and all amenities. Excellent service and facilities. Helpful, friendly staff. We stayed B&B but lunch and dinner are payable on an as you use basis - as far as I know it does not offer Fully Inclusive. We had very good first impressions of the hotel. We were met by the hotel porter with a golf buggy to take ourselves and luggage to the hotel at the pick up point which was only a hindered yards from the hotel entrance. We got a welcome drink of bubbly and we were told the minibar was free (but would not be restocked). A bit of a surprise was the Eur 49 \"Tourist Tax\" levied on tourists in Greece from 1st March through to October each year). The hotel is marble everywhere and is of a 4-Star rating and Adults Only. It has a pool and gym. The pool is shaded so you do have to move your loungers to follow the sun. The pool is quite small so in high season I expect it is very crowded. The hotel is ideal for access to the harbour, Old Town and shops and banks. There are plenty od cafes, supermarkets and restaurants within easy waling distance. Ideal for sight seeing. It's even close to Elli Beach. The breakfast is comprehensive with full English and very varied Continental breakfasts available from the buffet. But there is a draft in the main area designated for breakfast because the door has to remain open to access the English cooked breakfast near the pool. But you can also eat on the terrace and in the main dining area near the bar. The hotel doesn't have a lot of inhouse entertainment but there is a \"Greek Night\" (which underwhelmingly was just about ordering an Ouzo and Mezes), 2 Happy Hour Nights (Weds and Sundays) and a Music Night (a live piano in the dining room). I think they could da a bit better in this respect The hotel is very clean and everything works as it should. The room is large enough, though not capacious. It has a bacony (ours overlooked the pool area), with a shower, en-suite toilet etc, a free safe for valuables and the free (but not restocked) mini bar. I felt the room was good value for money all things considered. Have I been in more spacious rooms and better appointed rooms - yes. But this one is of a very high standard and I'd certainly rebook this for a future trip.",

First of all, when we get to the room, we noticed that pillows and duvets were all creased, like somebody would be using them. but hey, maybe they are just like that from laundry? NO, we found a lots of hairs , pubic hairs all over it, clearly somebody was sleeping there, also rest of the room was full of dirt and hairs everywhere. We have asked for duvets and pillow cases to be replaced, and this suppose to be completed asap...it took them over 5 hours to do that since check-in. Cleanliness level was very low, more over, there is a drain in the middle of the bathroom which smells horribly, we end up with covering it as the smell was unbearable. Prices in hotel bar were just over the top, not worth it at all. As a base for sleeping and going around Rhodes is OK, but other than that, I would not recommend it. ",
