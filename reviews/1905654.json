      "text": "A corner of paradise away from the noise and frenzy typical of Dubai. From the first moment of your arrival you notice how perfectly everything is taken care of. \nExcellent level of service from breakfast to the beach. I’m Italian And I can say that the food quality at Zest Restaurant is simply excellent.\nThe only complain is regarding the absence of a light lunch that you can enjoy on the beach or at the pool and for a five star resort that service cannot be missing. \nI also really appreciated the room upgrade that the Resort offered to me. \nThe gardens of the Resort are Amazing and even the new pool with a skyline view at sunset time is really precious .\nHope to come back in a near future.",

      "text": "I wanted to share my experience with One&Only The Palm hotel that is considered to be one of the best in the UAE. I wanted to make a booking and do a wedding photo session at the premises of this hotel, I contacted the hotel via application form on their official website, via e-mail and called them directly. My inquiry was really simple, I asked if it is possible to pay extra money and do an early check in (around noon) as we needed to prepare for photo session. During the day no one got back to me on this matter. I called one more time, made my query even more simple: I asked whether it is allowed to do a wedding photo session, just me and spouse, at the premises of this hotel, no one was able to respond to me and provide with information on procedure (like explaining that approval is required, timeframe when I should expect to get a feedback on this matter etc, no information). It is such an important occasion for me and it’s the first time when after sending a query through official communication channels to the hotel and no one responds. I was disappointed.",

      "text": "I am not one to leave reviews. My family typically stays in very nice resorts throughout the world. Almost all of them meet normal expectations. This resort is supposed to be the best one in Dubai. It was recommended highly by other people, and Tripadvisor gave it great reviews. It is far from that.\n\nFirst of all our Butler was not introduced to us until I went to the front desk to book an excursion, and found out they had no Concierge. Then our Butler was made known to us.\n\nIf you’re going to eat breakfast, at this resort, you need to expect hair and your food. We had that experience two times.\n\nIf you’re going to be at the pool or at the breakfast table, you will have to wait for service and usually flag someone down.\n\nToday’s breakfast was especially bad. They served us warm water, so we simply asked for glass of ice. We had to ask three times before we were able to get a glass of ice. 25 minutes later we actually got our glass of ice. The scrambled eggs were so runny, they literally were watery. I’ve never seen anything like that and trust me I’ve been in the restaurant industry a long time.  We had to ask three times to get ketchup as my daughter likes ketchup with her scrambled eggs. \n\nYou should expect to have to flag down people to get service. You should expect your drink glasses to be empty for a long time. \n\nWe stayed at this hotel during Ramadan. Most hotels in the area were quite discounted during this month. This hotel was not. And before you think it was because of Ramadan that the service was poor, please let me explain that the majority of the staff are not from here and not celebrating Ramadan.\n\nGood luck trying to get a golf cart to come pick you up from your “mansion” that is not near the front. When you call guest services and try to one you’ll see what I mean.\n\nIn a city with some of the best hotels in the world, please trust me go somewhere else. The One and Only is the one and only disappointment to our trip!\n\nPositives: renting a boat, car service out front.",
