The hotel was well staffed who were efficient, very cooperative and helped with any support required for tours, public transport guidance and advice about local area. The hotel is in the city centre, area outside can be noisy as expected. The locals again were lively and very helpful, put up with my awful Turkish attempts. Cannot fault the location, hotel and staff all were just fabulous. There are local supermarkets, money exchange, train station and sightseeing all five minutes away",

      "text": "The hotel itself was a comfortable the newish hotel down a very CD side street from the main drag they have obviously tried their hardest to upgrade the hotel which they've done not a bad job the reception and entrance area is clean tidy and very welcoming it has one lift that will serve all floors which is safe but be aware there is no internal door and you will see a moving wall on one side, on entering the room you will find a key card entry system with key card electricity controlling the fridge TV and air conditioning the air conditioning is maintained very well and works officially there is one English speaking news channel within the 40 plus channels on the television until very comfortable beds although the mattress are fast as firm, the bathroom is tight with millimeters to spare to close the door against the basin the wood used in the bathroom is obviously not of the type of that should be used in the bathroom bus the condition is shabby the shower is good with plenty of hot water and complementary shower gels and soaps if there are two of you in a room it would suggest that you will ask for an extra channel as they only supply you with one there is a fridge but no minibar one word of warning there is a very high step to get into the bathroom so if you have had a hip replacement or a knee replacement or you cannot lift your leg too high this may be a problem, we would not break the housekeeping too well as when we arrived there was pastrami left in the fridge when we checked in and only one cup for the tea and coffee making facilities this was however quickly rectified and the service we received from the staff was outstanding, breakfast is served from 7:00 a.m. till 10:00 a.m. and is over buffet style there is hot eggs turkey sausage plenty of different breads and simit, Jams honey's tea coffee and cereals, there is no parking of such but there is a concierge service that will park your car and retrieve it at a moment's notice this was highly recommended, the best way to get around is there is using the Izmir card which is available from the train station or the metro station which is just a 300 m walk from the hotel, we found this a great place to stay for a couple of days.",
