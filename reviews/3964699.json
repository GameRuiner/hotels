The view from the balcony was wonderful, looking down the beautiful streets and nearby old buildings. In the room it was very practical to have wc and shower divided. And the warm staffs made our trip very welcoming and happy. Overall 5 out of 5. We will definitely come back in the future.",

      "text": "Stayed at the Catalonia Gran Via BCN for one night, pre cruise, at the end of November 2023. The airport bus stops very close to the hotel (2nd stop from the airport), so it was just a five minute walk to the hotel.  On arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and offered a glass of cava in the hotel bar.  Our room, with balcony, overlooked the road to the front of the hotel but with the doors closed it was very quiet. The room was very well furnished and the bed was comfortable. The soft furnishings and linen, towels etc were all of high quality. The walk in shower was great. The only downside was that there was no tea/coffee/kettle in the room which was odd as we saw the provisions on the cleaner's trolley and noticed that the room next door did have this facility. A bottle of water was provided. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend the hotel.  ",
