      "text": "I wish I could give this stay a full 5 stars. I'm not one to give negative reviews but feel like I need to in this case. We stayed in this hotel 3 nights, and could barely sleep the last 2 because of no air conditioning. The weather was 80 degrees fahrenheit in the city at the time. We called to get this resolved and was told that management had the A/C on \"winter mode\" which doesn't get transitioned to \"summer mode\" until April 1st. We had the lack of a working A/C on 3/30 and 3/31 evenings. We addressed this by opening windows, which again, was not ideal because we're located in a busy part of the city, and to make matters worse, 3/31 was an election night so there was a lot of fanfare and chants happening outside.  Bottom line, if you're paying good money for a global brand you at a minimum would expect decent HVAC support.  Staff didn't suggest any alternatives (i.e. providing a fan).  Otherwise the stay was great - you cannot beat the location, room was excellent (we stayed at a suite) and the breakfast food was delicious. Just make sure when the whether is warm, you're there on April or later.",

Also our team members explained you the process during your stay.\nAccording to quick seasonal weather changes in İzmir region , some of our guests want cold in the day time, while others want warm weather from air condition in the evening time. \nRecently the temperature is 22-27 degrees during the day but it is 7-9 degrees in the evenings last weeks.  There are almost 15 degrees difference between day and evening.\n\nHowever, we would like to point out that we already switch our air conditioners to cold mode as of April 1 like every year according to majority of guest needs and more stable weather conditions.\n\nNevertheless, we will use your feedback to fine-tune our operation in the hope that upon your next visit, we can meet or exceed your expectations.\n\nBest Regards\n\nHotel management",
