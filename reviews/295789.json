Su is located down a short path to a quiet oasis, the rooms located around a lovely pool, and great open air restaurant and bar. \n\nAn unexpected charming boutique great value option in Bodrum \n\nAccess by car is a little difficult as itâ€™s on a busy one way road but once settled in the easiest way to get around is by foot using the picturesque lanes that connect to the harbour and sites. Google maps works well\n\nFood is tasty with a simple set dinner menu for fish, Vegetarian and carnivores. For carnivores a local butcher / restaurant Vefa is 5 minutes away is highly recommended (see seperate review) \n\nRooms are simple but perfectly adequate and staff could not be more friendly. \n\nAn excellent boutique hotel and superb value. Highly recommended. My new base for Bodrum !",

Close to city center, but not too close to all the noise.  Quick easy walk to the main street.\n-ADORABLE.  It is charming and beautiful and well cared for--just perfect.\n-AMAZING STAFF. They all act like it is THEIR hotel--so much PRIDE. One specific way they helped us was making our 6am hotel transfer easy!\n-For our family of four, it was great to have a big suite that comfortably slept all 4 of us (parents in a separate bedroom!) and the pool was lovely.
