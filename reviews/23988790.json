      "text": "The staff at this hotel are absolutely brilliant. Special mention must go out to Ibrahim at the pool bar and the life guard Rafat who both made our holiday. I travelled alone with my daughter and Rafat was so brilliant playing games with all the kids and keeping them entertained. Ibrahim is also excellent at his job and I did not feel like a solo parent because they were both so friendly and helpful.\nThe staff in the lobby bar were brilliant too, one who kept making animals (I don‚Äôt have his name) out of the fruit for my daughters cocktails, this guy is awesome and really deserves a special mention, absolutely outstanding service.\nOur hotel room was slightly shabby and needed a bit of work but honestly all that was completely overshadowed by the staff who were just absolutely brilliant. The lady on the front desk was also very helpful.\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the close proximity to Soho Square, it really is less than a 5 min walk but they even have a shuttle bus if you don‚Äôt fancy the walk. Brilliant.",
