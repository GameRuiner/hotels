      "text": "Jaz Aquamarine a Five Star, it isn't , nowhere near it, 3 at best!!!\nHotel grounds, pools etc superb. What drags this Hotel down is how its run & the staff. This was my sixth stay in a Jaz hotel in Egypt and this is by far the worse!\nThe rooms were'nt particularly that clean. The food in all the restaurants except the Asian was in general, lukewarm!!! Yes a lot of choice but would be better hot!!\nDrinks ok but sometimes glasses drinks are served in beggars belief, ie Espresso Martini in a small wine glass, beer in a small glass. They open a can to fill glass & put surplus back to fill next one..\nYou can leave your beach towels out in a bag to be replaced with clean ones. One day I got damp dirty ones!!! Not good enough!!!\nYou dine in the A La Carte & when you finish your meal they hand you a service questionnaire which is fine, to make their service better. What is wrong on every level is that before you leave they question a bad review quite aggressively & ask why!!!!  This should be read by management & acted on review by themselves!!!\nSunbeds, ok we all do the earlybird for where you want to sit. \nWent with Tui AIl Inc so had 3 a la carte meals thrown in. Four of us went to the Indian Reataurant for a second time, having used my quota & manager came upto in quite an aggressive manner stating that I had to pay 20euros each. The service was awful on every level & food not much better. The small beer glass, the confrontation on review, terrible. Complained on way out & offered a part free meal but not for all of us.  They never even offered to scrap the bill at the checkout on last day.\nIn all there attitude is that they do not give a ----!!!!\nMy advice is, go to a different hotel, BADLY RUN!!!",
