We visited the steak restaurant which was probably one of the best meals we have ever had. They went above and beyond to make it extra special.

      "text": "Our first family holiday to Titanic Marden Palace after seeing many amazing reviews on social media telling us how good it was.  And guess what? It did not disappoint!\n\nOur family of five ranged from age 7 through to 45 and there was something for everybody.  Indoor and outdoor heated swimming pools.  24hr bistro restaurant. 24hr bars.  Unlimited play on arcade machines. Bowling alley. Pool tables.  Badminton.  Massive chess board outside.   Kids club. A gym. Live music performance every night.  The list goes on...\n\nAlso also the food was amazing. \nTop quality meals cooked by multinational chefs that cater to all tastes, from carnivores to vegans.   Nobody is left out.   Waiters take your drink orders from your table.  They clear buffet plates off you very quickly. Happily working hard and attentive every single meal.\n\nNo request is too much for any waiter or staff member.   And you don't get any judgement when asking for mutiple cakes or drinks or snacks.  Because after all it is an all inclusive resort and we like to get our money's worth!\n\nHousekeeping staff were polite and friendly, even apologising when they came to tidy our room and woke us but it was our fault we forgotten to press Do Not Disturb. \n\nWe spent 9 days here and would come again.  Recommended!\n\nOur dates were  23 March to 1 April 2024.",
