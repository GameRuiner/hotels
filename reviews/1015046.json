      "text": "This was our third time at Sofitel Dubai The Palm. I will start with the good things. The staff is very kind, helpful as always. The food was great, especially in the specialty restaurants. Our favourite was the Hong Long, which was absolutely fantastic! The AC was nice, it was not too cold or too warm. The sport bar still the best place in the whole hotel with the best bartenders! And the negative things: the breakfast was always problematic. The food did not change, the same kind of food was every single day. After 5 days it was boring. But there was a bigger problem: every single breakfast was like a jungle. Not because of the kids, because of the parents. Left buggies were everywhere (in middle of the corridor),  they acted like they are the only person there. I know, it is a family friendly hotel, but it does not mean that everybody can do whatever they want. Kids are kids. But adults should behave much better. The hotel is getting very old, our room was very used, with dirty sheets, curtains and carpet. The hotel desperately needs a renovation.",
