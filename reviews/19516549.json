The staff at this place were all great. Great hospitality. They go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. The location is top notch. You get the most mesmerizing view of the Burj. The bed was super comfy. I will always stay at this property whenever i am travelling to or through. Love the charm of this hotel. Does not give you the routine chain hotel vibe at all.

The hotel is situated in the most popular part of Dubai with easy access to all the major restaurants and mainly Dubai Mall. The hotel is equipped with all necessary amenities and is perfect to stay with family. The house keeping and front office staff were very helpful. The best part of my stay that I would like to highlight is the Burj view. I would definitely visit the property again and would highly recommend the same to my friends and family.",
