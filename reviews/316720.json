      "text": "I stayed here in July with my young family, sister, her partner and daughter. The hotel in general surpassed my expectations. The rooms was lovely and clean, our cleaner who I can’t remember her name was so sweet with my two daughters and it was spotless everyday, we upgraded to a larger room and it was so spacious, the room was quiet even though overlooking the pool with beds that was both large and comfy especially when you often get children who need cuddles in the night all four of us could fit comfortably in one bed.\nThe pool isn’t too deep so perfect for children to play in, I thought i would never get them out, and the shaded pool was perfect in the heat in Rhodes in July, the pool meanders round it is lovely. \nThe staff at this hotel are some of the best I’ve ever experienced so friendly from the cleaners to management and always happy to help.\nThe hotel is dated but I think it adds to the charm but it is clean, well maintained, and authentic, my only downside was the salt water pool which could sting the eyes but once the girls got there goggles it didn’t bother them anymore.\nFood and drinks was fabulous in the pool bar and the restaurants, the souvlaki stand is great for afternoon snacks! (note to add here is that the hotel prices for food and drink is not anymore expensive than the bars and restaurants outside the hotel) also it is only a short walk to the bars and restaurants of Ixia. Rhodes town is a must to visit in the day and also at night and only a short taxi ride, we also did a boat trip to Lindos which was great value and a lovely day to explore the meandering streets of this little medieval town and the acropolis.\nUnfortunately we was here when the wildfires broke, however nowhere near this area the staff kept us well informed and seemed concerned for ours and others safety advising us where and where not to go, all of Rhodes stood together and there was an immense sense of togetherness at this time and they looked after all the tourists who was affected. this did effect where we could visit but didn’t affect our experience, it only made me love Rhodes and it’s people more.\nOverall a great holiday i would recommend it to friends and family, great value authentic hotel, a great place to explore this beautiful island with great Grecian hospitality, ",

      "text": "I stayed here with my girlfriend and her daughter with the sister and her family staying too.\nThe children would have happily stayed at the hotel, playing in the pool every day if it wasn't for the adults wanting to explore the island a bit more. The nearby beach was a short walk away and also a hit with the children and Rhodes town is less than 10 minutes by taxi.\nPanagiotis who worked at the swim up bar was great, as was Anna working in the Ice Cream bar, often seen walking around and tidying up after some of the guests.\nUnfortunately, my girlfriend's daughter got food poising (from elsewhere) towards the end of the holiday and was very sick. The reception and cleaning staff were absolute superstars! Irini on reception in particular was very caring and helped us arrange for a doctor to come and visit us at the hotel instead of us having to travel.\nFortunately it was only for one day and she was back to her old self, playing in the pool and having a great time.\nWe only ate once at the hotel, in the Mexican restaurant and the food and service was excellent. The bar staff were also great when we had drinks before going out each night. Breakfast had lots of options which was great for picky young eaters and hungry adults alike.\nWould definitely recommend this hotel for family stays and just want to thank the staff again for looking after us when it was needed.",
