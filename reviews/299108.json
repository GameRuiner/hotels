      "text": "We‚Äôve been regular visitors since 2009 and it honestly feels like we‚Äôre going to our second home. We immediately go into total relax mode when we get our complimentary pick up at Sharm airport knowing how well we‚Äôre going to be looked after. The complimentary pick up is available to everyone, just email the hotel a week before your arrival with flight details. It‚Äôs only a short 10mins transfer.\n\nIt‚Äôs always been a great hotel but the improvements we‚Äôve seen over the years have been incredible. I don‚Äôt think the owner/ senior management will ever rest on their laurels! The food is exceptional and there are plenty of bars and snack areas to suit everyone‚Äôs taste. \n\nIt was really good to see a lot more English people having their first visit & raving about the hotel. Think this is probably down to the hotel working with EasyJet to offer package holidays. Just a shame that EasyJet don‚Äôt fly from any Scottish airport yet!\n\nThe jewel in the crown at the Sultan Gardens is, and always has been, the staff & a number of them have become our friends over the years. They are super friendly but treat you with the utmost respect. From the gardeners to housekeeping, lifeguards, bar staff, kitchen staff, waiting staff & chefs they will meet you with a warm smile and will be willing to go that extra mile to make your holiday unforgettable. As one first time guest said ‚Äú They know what you want before you even know it yourself‚Äù Feedback doesn‚Äôt get any better than that. \n\nA couple of photos af Adham & Mohammed who looked after us so well at North 38 pool\n\nNext visit already booked!\nLouise & Fiona",
