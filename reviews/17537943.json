      "text": "OMG! What a place, e have the top floor, it is gorgeous. Host is the best, place is fantastic, we are treated like a king & queen. Our suit had two bedrooms, a large living room, kitchen and bathroom. We also have an access to the roof top. We did some sightseeing, we had wonderful breakfast at the wonderful hosts' expense, as well as a dinner. Muge-the owner, her daughter Melissa, their right hand man Ufuk all were really friendly and nicest people around. We already decided to come back with our daughters, we want them to experience the best treatment up to now. Wonderful, historic building, nice location, excellent setting. Very specious, open concept, all the amenities are great. We loved the place and hostess'. They deserve more than 5 Star. We have not faced anything bad, forget about average. Everything is best of best. Thanks for everything. ",
