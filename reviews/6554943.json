      "text": "We were walk-in guests, made to feel very welcome. Our hostess was so helpful and looked after us so well. Helped with our car hire, showed us a local restaurant which served us a great meal, and was generally a great ambassador for the pansiyon and the village. \nThe accommodation was in a unit with 3 bedrooms next to the pretty patio, furnished with white wooden tables with blue seats and long loungers.\nThe bedrooms were nicely decorated, with iron beds, very comfortable mattresses and lovely pillows! Beautiful felt carpets covered the unit's lounge floor... made in the area. It was so pleasant to go to sleep with windows, open a full moon shining, and to the sound of crickets. \nWe didn't stay for breakfast because of our early departure.\nLovely village, great stay... very good value for money.\nThank you Alya Pansiyon!",

      "text": "good location and great value! the pansiyon is actually located in Sirince village! service is warm, friendly and a lovely family running the place, they do make you feel at home :) rooms are clean and very well kept, everything works as expected, its comfy and cozy and one of the rooms has a great view of the village. useful and informative (especially of trekking info around area), trustworthy, and breakfast was lovely, generous and delicious, dinner can be arranged too. sud definitely try their fish dinner for only 10 euro, fantastic value and sumptious! highly recommended!!!!! :) minibus to Sirince village runs from selcuk bus terminal every 15mins, journey about 15mins and the last one is at 8.20pm, costing 3 tl. and if u are thinking of walking the ascending and winding mountain 7km road with your luggage, its not worth saving the 3tl! definitely the place to stay if one is visiting Ephesus as well (10mins from selcuk bus terminal)!",

Our vacation was winding down so we couldn't stay another night. Surinci is a wonderful little town with many artisans and shops.",
