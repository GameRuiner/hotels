Our room was really spacious. From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated so well by all the staff especially Hamza the bellman and Stanel from the restaurant. The food at the restaurants were amazing. The chef at Cucina even made a soup off menu for our 8 month old baby. Thank you for the lovely stay.",

      "text": "Lovely family holiday over the Easter period, we visited with our two children 6years and 3 years. A special mention must go to Aravind who from our first initial contact was so helpful and he went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible, nothing was too much trouble and he would always check in and see how we were getting on. Our children really took a shine to him and are still talking about him now, he really is an asset to this hotel. We enjoyed this hotel for 10 days and it was in the perfect location, everywhere was really easy to get to and was a great base. We used the taxi app “ Careem” which I would recommended downloading as they were really reliable and reasonable in price. Both my children enjoyed kids club and visited it a couple of times, each time one of us needed to stay with them as my littlest is 3 years and they need to be 4 years to leave them by themselves. The women at kids club very welcoming and it felt very safe. What I would say is they could do with pumping some money into the facilities in the kids club. I walked around it on the first day and felt a little underwhelmed by the toys on display, some didn’t work maybe needed new batteries, the teddies looked a bit grubby, just felt like they needed some more interactive toys. Food across the hotel was very good, however service around the pool very slow and sometimes waiting 15 /20 minutes for your drink. Breakfast such a great choice and delicious, did feel a little chaotic all be it in the Easter holidays so hotel probably at peak however it felt it needed more staff serving, as all the staff were very busy clearing and cleaning tables you would really have to find someone to ask for water on the table. One gentleman who did stand out was Tharry, very efficient and warm smile. Hotel grounds very clean, rooms very comfortable and clean. Do feel hotel lacked atmosphere of a evening, would be lovely to have a bit of entertainment at Myamni bar whilst having a evening drink. Would be great if the hotel was to have a lobby bar. Kids all inclusive menu was very good did feel slightly limited for options in the day around the pool. Pool area is lovely and clean do need to be at your sunbed by 9-10am in peak in order to get a bed around the pool, everyone seemed to enjoy music that was played when water aerobics was on but when this finished it could sometimes feel abit flat could be a opportunity to have some music around the pool more often at key times. Overall a lovely clean hotel, and good value for money. Thank you for a lovely stay.",

When I do, I hope you fix a few small things:\n- There is a long line every morning to get to breakfast. Really takes a while to get seated\n- When they eventually seat you, please find a system do that no one takes your table while you go to get food\n\nBut all in all very good, my kids particularly loved the place.",
