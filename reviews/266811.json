      "text": "Nice hotel for my first solo travel experience. Room was clean, reception were very friendly, snug but only really used the room for a base to shower, sleep and keep my bag. \nReally accessible from the metro, some lovely little cafes around by the hotel for breakfast etc. \nSagrada familia was close, around a 10 min walk. Also walked to Park Güell, which was a bit longer of a walk but nonetheless still walkable - though very hilly so worth considering other transport to get there if with a pushchair or wheelchair.\n\nReception staff were super helpful, I asked for the best way to get to the airport and was advised that with a suitcase taking the metro would be best - the staff member drew on the metro map to show me exactly where to go/change etc, it took roughly an hour but was very easily done! Would also recommend an hola Barcelona travel card for use on the metro etc, was reasonably priced and made my life so much easier with respect to travel! \n\nI was also able to keep my suitcase and travel bag in the hotel for the day when I checked out, then changed in the reception amenities before getting the metro to the airport.\n\nMy only negative feedback, two things. The metalwork under the sink in the bathroom had a sharp corner, I scratched my leg on it and 3 weeks later it’s scarred at the moment. It was only superficial but just something to be careful of! \nThe other feedback I have, is on one night around 2/3am in the night the fire alarm went off. We all evacuated via the fire exit, made our way down the stairs - reached the bottom but in the dark it seemed the only exit was then back into the hotel? Could very well be that due to being suddenly awaken the guests in front of me that I followed did not notice the proper exit. \nUpon getting down the stairs, word was passed amongst guests there was no fire to worry about and to go back to bed. I didn’t see any staff members, and the next morning, there was no idea as to what had happened or caused us all to evacuate at 2am. \n\n",

      "text": "I ended up in three separate room for reasons below. Each was okay re size and amenities etc. one had a terrace, one a balcony and the third neither. If you have a room on the 6th floor the elevator goes to the fifth and you have to use stairs for the final floor. Other than the ants, all rooms were clean with kettle, safe, fridge. There was a tv, but no idea if good or not as I didn’t use it. Internet was free and pretty fast for a hotel.\n\nMy fist night was good, however when I returned to my room the second evening there were hundreds of flying ants all over the bed, floor and in the bathroom. They were everywhere and I went to reception to complain. The lady on reception came to my room to see and immediately told me to pack my bags and she would give me a new room. However in this room the electricity would not work. The card slots into a gadget that activates the electricity and it would not work. Again I contacted the receptionist and she could not get it to work. She tried to contact maintenance but it was very late and they simply said they would fix it the next day. I had to leave that room and was told no others were available. As it was 11 pm I asked her to find me another hotel, but she could not fine one. I was getting very stressed and upset by now as it was so late I was exhausted. Eventually, after about half an hour I was given a third room which was allocated to another guest who hadn’t turned up yet. No idea what they did with them if they arrived. \n\nAlthough i got another room, I was so tired and so stressed it completely ruined my stay. I was offered no compensation for the hassle and feel the hotel should have offered me a discount for all the issues I faced. I have no issues with the receptionist as she tried to fix the problem.\n\nIf my review was based on my first night I would give it a 5/5. But the second gets 1/5.",
