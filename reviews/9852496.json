      "text": "Just recently stayed at Midtown Apartments with a lot of girls . We had 3 apartments- they were absolutely stunning - very modern ,  as we expected ! The photos are very accurate. \nClassy,  comfortable ,clean, well stocked with everything you need . Comfy beds , toiletries in the bathrooms.\nThe apartments are ideally based for the Gothic quarter , La Ramblas , Ciutadella Park  and the wonderful Sagrada Famalia   which are all within walking distance . \nConveniently located within a 7 minute walk from Mainline railway stations from the airport and also a main square - Placa Catalunya where the Aerobus from the airport stops too .\nWould 200% recommend these beautiful apartments and admire the views from their rooftop pool with loungers - idyllic with a cocktail watching the sun set . \nThe staff were very polite and  went above and beyond to help us. \nCheck in was swift , hence we settled into our mini Hen break with ease.\nShall definitely return .",

We rented a two bedroom two bath apartment, and it gave my 14-year-old grandson his privacy during the trip. The apartment is very updated with a lot of amenities. It was immaculate. There is a store just within a couple of blocks where you can get groceries. Also, Daniel was an absolute jewel. He was very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this apartment hotel to anyone that stays in Barcelona.",

The staff are friendly and helpful ( booked taxis and made restaurant recommendations and provided maps and lots of general info),  its spotlessly clean, rooms are large, king sized comfortable bed, 2 tv,s, great shower, full kitchen, a welcome pack with some essentials,  bag storage, great air con……the list goes on!\nIt’s also in a perfect location for all the main tourist attractions which are all walkable. One tip make sure you book tickets for Casa Battlo, Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia etc. well in advance as they sell out quickly. We could not get tickets for the parc despite visiting in February.",
