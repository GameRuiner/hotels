      "text": "If possible, I would have rated this a 4.5 out of 5. We stayed at the Majestic for 6 nights in late March. We (a family of 4) had a suite with a connecting room for the kids. The rooms were spacious with a nice view from our suite and no view for the kids. The hotel is situated perfectly in the high end district and we found it to be very quiet in our rooms, even when the road was busy or the sidewalks were jammed. It felt like we could walk anywhere in 15-30 minutes, so that was fantastic. \n\nSome highlights: The staff that handled the restaurant for our breakfast each morning (it was included with the rooms) were great. They were super friendly, always pleasant and ensured that we were taken care of. The cleaning staff was tremendous!!!! I could not say more about them, as our room was taken care of each day and waters were replenished. The crew that handled the rooftop were also great. Definitely recommend going there at night to get a beautiful view of the city and enjoy a drink or dessert. There are lots of great restaurants within 10-15 minutes, including some of our favorites: Vinitus (Tapas), Shanghai Stories (Chinese) and Bembi (Indian). \n\nMinor problems: Things look a little dated in the rooms, but nothing too bad. The pillows in the room weren't the greatest, super soft and your head immediately hit the bed. The staff welcoming you into the hotel (not the front desk / check-in team) weren't the friendliest, which is odd because it's the first thing you experience as you are walking up to the hotel. They have automatic doors, so maybe that plays into it a bit and there isn't a need for anyone to open the door.\n\nWe would definitely recommend if you want a great hotel that gives you easy access to shopping, restaurants, and short walks to many of the best sites & neighborhoods in Barcelona.",

      "text": "We stayed in a Master Suite with a view to the main street. Really nice room. Lots of light coming from the 2 balconies. Roof top terrace is exceptional with at view to Sagrada Família and the olympic city. The evenings are outstanding. The pool is not really a pool; hence the hotel is best suited for off season stays as the beach is 3 km away. Shopping and great restaurants are around the corner, taxi’s low price and easy to get hold off. Restaurant was disappointing, no atmosphere but reasonable prices. Enjoy your dinner at the roof top. Breakfast is great but not at six senses level.  Good service experience. Fitness is small but high quality. Barcelona is too crowded in season, if you go outside high season, I would recommend to stay at Majestic.",
