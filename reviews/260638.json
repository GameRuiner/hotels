      "text": "Just returned from four nights here where I paid to upgrade to a Superior room. Upon check in was assigned to room 401, which had a very bad wifi signal (was getting about 2 bars of signal and a \"weak connection\" notice on my devices). I brought this up to the front desk shortly after I arrived and then again the following morning - they shared the hotel was booked to capacity and the wifi is being used by many guests (which is not a good excuse - budget hotels and hotels with 1,000+ rooms have good wifi). Anyway, after some back and forth, they moved me to Room 403 and the wifi worked perfectly for the rest of my stay. Thank you to the staff that helped facilitate that.\n\nLocation is good - right around the corner from the Arc de Triomf in the heart of El Born. Very good size room, housekeeping came daily, a bit of noise but that is to be expected when facing a street in the old city, breakfast was very tasty, there was a mini bar and snacks.\n\nFew other minor flaws are the pool was closed (did not get notification before and when I went up to the roof to see if it was possible to at least sit up there, it was all closed off with caution tape). The hotel had the AC turned off even though Spring has started and temperatures were around 21C/70F. Also, for this type of hotel, Catalonia should have Nespresso machines in, which is common in nicer hotels like NH Hotels (they have a kettle in room and powder to make coffee, which is just not great quality).",

She was so helpful, worked incredibly hard and always had a smile on her face .\nWe stayed in a superior room with comfortable  beds and a large bathroom with a bath and a separate large shower .\nWhat made our stay so wonderful was the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff . \nSpecial thanks to Guillem  and Rachel on reception who went out of their way to help us with any query that we had and they booked a local restaurant for us on our last night .\nWe had a wonderful stay in Barcelona which we loved , but it is the staff that were the icing on the cake .
