My biggest gripe is the noisy ladies who without fail wake up my whole family including my little ones at 7.15am every morning when they are cleaning rooms. They shout to each other so conversations can be heard word for word. Especially difficult when our time difference is 2 hours. People work hard so a bit of extra sleep on holiday is worth a lot to most people",

      "text": "Hotel area is big and has a nice beach and decent pools (Slightly cold ones during mid-October, but not an issue to us at least). \n\nOur family room had 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. It was old, pretty worn and slightly noisy. The other sleeping room had only one light switch, which made it either reeeeally bright, or dark at the nighttime. Curtains were great, beds were decent and we slept well nevertheless. \n\nThe staff is great. We had a few issues with our room during the stay but  everything was cleared efficiently.\n\nEverything around the hotel is really clean which is a huge plus for us. We were there with two toddlers and couldn't be more happier with them when using the toilets.\n\nThere was a lot food available everywhere, but everything was pretty blunt for our taste. Also it felt, like everything was overcooked on purpose, \"just to be sure\" various seafood options, but unfortunately overcooked all the time. Still, we didn't leave with hunger never and there was always something for the kids.\n\nThe \"outdoor play area\" could have more things to do for kids and it was pretty off from everything else.\n\nThis might sound like a negative feedback, but overall it was a great stay and we could come back in future.",
