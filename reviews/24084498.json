      "text": "We didn‚Äôt want to wait to write this until end of our holiday. We are staying in the room 18208. Last year, we also came here for our vacation and had some small issues but management team solved everything immediately and made our holiday better. This year, we were a bit worried what we had last year but starting from the first moment, everything is just perfect, there is nothing to criticize. This hotel is completely different than any hotel. I have stayed many hotels in my life, I am so picky and my expectations are always high and this hotel is already fulfilled my expectations even in 2 days. All the stuff is amazing. Cannot compare with last year. Everyone is ready to make you comfortable and satisfied. Best hotel restaurant experience in my life, there is no open buffet, all the restaurants are a la carte and it is all up to you what you want to eat and quality of the food is excellent. It is totally a A+ elite hotel. Do not compare any hotel before you come to Meraki. Everyone must have this experience. Special thanks to Mrs. Olena and Mr. Ayman. We will come again with no doubt.",
