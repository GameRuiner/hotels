There are beaches, pools, aqua park, restaurants, kids club and sports amenities and entertainment for adults and kids. Food has been outstanding, service overall has been on the best level! The stuff is helpful, friendly and showing the unbeatable oriental hospitality. Everyone is showing their best in order to make and keep the guests happy and all their needs to be met. After a day full of adventures in the water park or on the beach even our house keeper Yasser has made us smile as every time we  came back in the room there was an animal or a flower made of folded towels and there was something new awaiting our daughter - a shirt of the Rixy club, kids flipflops  or  soft pink bath robe  for her. She was awaiting with impatience our return in the room in order to see what will be there and for us adults it was a pleasure to see how tidy and clean the room can be every day. We were able to relax in the best way and definitely would come back again to this Rixos hotel!",

      "text": "Family of 5 stayed for a week in a family suite over Easter holidays.  Considered one of the best all inclusive resorts in Sharm, thought useful to provide some tips if you’re thinking of booking:\n\n1. We stayed in the main resort, which is huge and grand. We spent 3 days in the aqua park side which in hindsight was probably the better option, it’s surprisingly more peaceful, smaller so easier to get around, the buffet restaurant is more chilled and quality of food better than the main resort. It’s also cheaper and newer. The only downside is not being so close to the beach but the shuttle service is good. Also the evening shows in the main resort are loud and don’t stop until 23:30. Lastly, the kids club is much better on the aqua park side.\n\n2. Bring about $100 usd as tips, it goes a long way, we gave our cleaner $20 on day 1 and he was amazing, over stocked our fridge with our favourite drinks and snacks, gave the kids snorkels, bath robes, toys for the beach etc. was always on hand to help getting the push chair down the stairs.\n\n3. Bring snorkel equipment, the snorkelling at the end of the Jetty is great for casual snorkelling if you don’t want to do a trip. They provide life jackets and flippers but not the snorkel and mask. The price of snorkels and masks in the hotel and surrounding shops are over priced and the keepers didn’t seem even remotely interested in haggling.",

      "text": "Visited this hotel over Easter 2 adults and 2 children aged 15 and 11 yrs old. We had booked a family suite and on check in we were upgraded to 2 junior suits with an interconnecting door- Room numbers 6006 and 6007. We found the rooms amazing I was greeted with a birthday cake and towel art, rooms were always cleaned to a good standard and the mini bar was restocked every day with wines, beers, soft drinks, crisps and chocolate. I was worried after reading other reviews that booking the al a carte restaurants would be an issue however after scanning the QR code on the tv as long as you book at 08:00 am as the bookings go live I managed to get into the mangal, Brazilian and salt and I also booked the Greek over at the aqua side through guest relations. Over all we loved the hotel, the kids used the Aqua park and go karting, we enjoyed the snorkelling and enjoyed the fountain pool- drinks we found mostly good however sometimes we had a nice plastic glass and sometimes we had a paper cup which I’m not a fan of, also they serve the slush in a paper cup the size of a shot glass which was a bit odd. Unfortunately there were a few little issues stopping me giving a 5 star rating- although the food was very good at restaurants the drinks service really lets it down at both mangal and the Brazilian we had to ask for drinks more than once and they arrived after we had finished the meal. The buffet was the same we went to the bar to be told they would send drinks over, they never came in the end. We normally had dinner at the snack bar in the afternoon and the hygiene here I noticed was poor lots of birds eating food at the tables which weren’t cleared away and on a few occasions I noticed a staff member picking up fries which had fell out of the tray and putting them back into the tray for people to eat- no gloves used and this really put me off!\nWe would be back in the future and had an amazing holiday \n\nTIP- there is a QR code on the tv in the bedroom for a bot you can ask anything you want to know. \nLifeguards will move your towels in the morning so you need to stay with them or put towels down after breakfast",
