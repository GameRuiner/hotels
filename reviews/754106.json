Had an amazing time in dubai and thoroughly enjoyed my holiday  would definitely come back but unfortunately not to this hotel.\nI am writing this from my breakfast table where I have been waiting now for 45 minutes for a latte ...not a one off sadly, also waited 15 minutes for butter on 2 occasions by which time toast was cold ,made more toast then eggs were cold  . Breakfast is chaotic yet there seems to be plenty of staff \nThis is also the case in the bar for the 4pm till 6pm complimentary drinks slow and disorganised\nSunbeds ! Well basically not enough for number of guests ...pool guys are very good and helpful this is not their fault management should provide more ...I haven't come to a supposedly 5 star hotel to sit on a beanbag or a mat \nRooms were very clean and the cleaners do an excellent job and are helpful and friendly \nFood is good and plenty of it with a good choice if restaurants in the hotel ...the Lebanese was my favourite \nAll in all a pleasant stay but would not return\n",
