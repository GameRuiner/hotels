      "text": "The hotel is fantastic, the staff are so friendly and hard working really go out of the way to ensure your stay is the best. The pool and beach are nice to relax by. There is a good variety of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking the beach area/sea, would really recommend booking the sea view rooms. The reception manager Khan Mazz was superb in sorting out some issues with the beds in the room due to a problem from the travel agent so that was greatly appreciated!\nTika Dala near the reception area always greeted us with a smile, Merlyn at the kids club was fab with our little boy, he was even asking for her and wanted to play in the kids club after breakfast, Samadhi in the restaurant area was really attentive and welcoming when we came to eat, and the tall manager in the restaurant kept the kids well entertained and always had a smile and very welcoming attitude. Aqua fitness is great too, could do this whilst the little one was in the kids club. The staff at reception and the front desk are also very helpful. Thank you all for a fantastic holiday!",
