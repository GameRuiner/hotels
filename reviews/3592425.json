Got it booked through an agent still our experience at the hotel wasn't something that was expected. We had booked their suite, the room looked fancy but there were many glitches in our experience. \n\nRoom:\nUpon reaching the hotel, my son was hungry and wanted to have fruits. So I called the in room dining and asked for a plate and knife. After which I learnt that we have to pay 20 AED if we wanted cutlery. After repeated requests they only sent a knife. This is the first hotel that we have travelled where we need to pay for the cutlery. So if you want to stay here please carry cutlery along. \n\nWashroom:\nThe service in the suite was very substandard. The toiletries were given upon asking and wasn't placed from before. The bathtub needed to be fixed, as the water wasn't getting drained out. \n\nBreakfast: \nThe biggest disappointment was breakfast. As there were limited options and everyday a fixed standard menu was there. Not a single alteration in the menu was there. The staff at the breakfast counters always looked really grumpy. \n\nFor my son's birthday celebration we requested for a cake and decoration. We were just provided a cake and a few balloons. There was no candle provided. \n\nOverall experience was not worth it! Wouldn't visit again.",
