      "text": "We visited a couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed this hotel. We arrived the early hours and were checked in easily and by lovely staff. We had a double, which had a massive comfy bed, kitchen area and bathroom. All very clean and was serviced regularly during our 6 day stay.  \nThe location is amazing few mins walk from the marina and beach area.  There is loads of mini markets nearby and the metro is about 10 mins away. We used the metro our whole trip and travelled all over dubai.  We didn't use any hotel facilities so cannot comment. But the staff were lovely and helpful at all times and if you needed anything it wasn't a problem.  We were just looking for somewhere we could just use as a base, clean and central and we were very happy with our choice.",

      "text": "The hotel cannot be easy found even with a taxi, there is no sign. We arrived tired after a long flight, the guy at the reception was rude and with an attitude. We showed our reservation with booking.com where we booked a studio overlooking the city. We were told that the hotel was full and we were left with a room without a window. We said that we would not go to such a room, I generally have a panic attack in enclosed spaces. The guy at the reception answered that this is not a problem with the hotel and if we don’t take it, look for another hotel at your own expense and they won’t give any money back. We called Booking.com and asked for help since on their website there is a studio with a window on the city, but we were politely told that They can’t help and we have to decide with the hotel. We were deceived by both the hotel and booking!!! \nWe had to book another hotel and pay 650 euros for that night (including two reservations). No one wants to return our money and restore justice, the owners have completely lost their conscience. I'm sure no one will take care of you if you stay there. Avoid this terrible hotel and the inhumane staff there!",

All requests were immediately fulfilled. Very clean. Constant change of bed linen and towels. We would like to thank Anil from the housekeeping department for the cleanliness and order in the room. \n\nWe lived in a room without a balcony. At first we were upset, and then we appreciated the silence, because on the other hand it could be a bit noisy. The room is large with a mini kitchen and a minimal but sufficient set of necessary items. The hotel is located next to the red metro line, which allows easy access to most attractions. It's also very convenient in terms of access to Dubai (DXB) airport.\n\nFor breakfast you need to go to another hotel of the same chain. In our opinion, breakfast is complete and varied, and every day there is something new. It was delicious and there was enough of everything.\n\nThere are many shops nearby. We used almaya store which is on the way to DMCC metro. We liked the selection there the most. But there's also a Viva shop not far away: cheaper but less choice. There are also many local cafes/restaurants nearby to suit every taste and budget.\n\nWe would also like to express our gratitude to Anna, who works at the hotel and helps to choose excursions. Anna can find an approach to everyone. We went to Abu Dhabi with our guide Sergey and it was an amazing trip.\n\nOf course, there are certain little things, but we are not so picky that they outweigh the huge advantages of the hotel. Yes, the hotel is not new, but it is quiet, calm and friendly people work there. We recommend this area and this hotel.",
