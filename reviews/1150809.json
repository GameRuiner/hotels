We told the staff that our room was suffocatingly hot and they told us there was nothing we could do besides deal with it . They wouldn't even let us open a window, made it incredibly difficult to sleep and was overall a wildly uncomfortable overnight experience with having to wake up covered in sweat. The staff are uninterested in the guests and will not help you with any problems.",

      "text": "It was filthy- the bed had a hairball on it and the shower was mouldy and covered in fake tan. The kitchen was hot and disgusting- no one was washing their dishes after themselves or keeping the bench clear, and the kitchen had an awful smell that we couldn’t get rid of because there is no fan or AC and the windows don’t open. I stayed in a four person mixed dorm and it was tiny- you can’t even walk past someone standing by their bed without brushing their shoulders. It was so hot at night that we couldn’t sleep, the mattress was terrible, and the other residents were soo loud and would run up the hallway shouting constantly and at all hours of the night.  My locker in the room was so tall I couldn’t even reach it, and being on the top bunk there wasn’t anywhere to put my bag expect on my bed with me. The curtains let in a lot of light in the morning as well. ",

We stayed in the 4-person private room, and it was a little bit scrunched for space, but definitely doable. This was the first hostel I’ve stayed at that has an elevator and room card keys! Great facilities and very nice staff. Also, it’s an awesome location!",

      "text": "Great location as was very close to a metro on the main line; however, the rooms were not adequate by far. Not only was the roof in the bathroom leaking and made of straw, but the bedsheets and duvet had semen and feces stains on them that had clearly not been cleaned for a long time. The lockers were far too small to contain any number of items, and the ladders made it almost impossible to get up to the top bunks. The food that I managed to swallow was disgusting and the elevators had a permeant stench of sick. The air-conditioning did not work, and the lights would randomly turn off. To give credit, the views from the constantly locked windows, were very nice and the shower worked fairly well.",
