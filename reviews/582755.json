      "text": "Was our first time in Egypt and  we came up trumps for sure 🤗\nThe hotel when you first arrive looks very unassuming compared to some of the other grand facades, but on entering you’re welcomed into a huge reception / seating area with a beautiful hanging light. From arriving we had the most welcoming staff and this continued throughout our holiday they cannot do enough to help/please you. Our room was a lovely large room quite modern for the usual Egypt rooms I’d reviewed, we had a lovely guy who cleaned our room everyday left clean towels ( sometimes in art displays ) and replenished our mini bar we got 2 large bottles of water everyday as well as fruit juice and soft drinks.\nThe resort itself was huge and always immaculately clean. \nThe desert rose has 4 restaurants you can use as well as the palm which is the main restaurant, sadly the Lebanese one was being refurbished while we was there, we did try the Italian which was ok just not for us . the Mexican we really enjoyed we went twice during our stay a young lad called malad waited on us again couldn’t do enough to make sure we enjoyed our meal he’s such a friendly lad we spoke often at the snack bar he served at during the day to.If you visit I would recommend the sweet corn soup its delicious and the fajitas 😋\nWe didn’t try the fish restaurant as sadly my hubby isn’t a fan of fish unless it’s wrapped in batter 🤣 it does have rave reviews though \nOne of my favorite bars would have to be the Tropicana it’s the first bar you see as you come through the main reception area this is a more chilled out bar we had a lovely pianist playing one evening you can grab a cappuccino if you don’t fancy a drink \nThe food was fantastic the choice was unbelievable, always hot and fresh , I loved the omelette station in a morning for breakfast or two dippy eggs on toast, ( again the man who made these outside the palm restaurant always smiling and chatty ) the pasta station for making your own from ingredients to sauce and choice of pasta. \nAlways fish and meats of choice \nThe desserts wow so light and delicious especially the coconut macaroons they were the hubbys favorite. \n\nIf your thinking about it don’t hesitate book it you won’t regret it \n\nAs a couple we have travelled to many places but this one was one that we wished we had booked a longer stay we truly didn’t want to go home \nWe have booked already to go back 🤗",

Rooms were always clean and tidy. Could not have asked for a better experience. Also the resort is only 15 mins taxi ride from the airport which was really convenient. Very safe atmosphere, great for families or couples. Highly recommend!",
