      "text": "We went as a three to this hotel - us and my 16 year old.  The family room set up here is perfect.  Technically we had two rooms - 18 &19, but they shared an 'external' door to the rest of the hotel. So my 16yo had their own room and bathroom, as did we.  All the benefits of a family room but they weren't on a sofa bed in the corner.  That was brilliant.  \n\nThe hotel too is great.  Location is at the top of the ramblas, nr Pl Catalunya.  The staff are all absolutely lovely. Hotel is perfectly placed to explore El Raval and the Barri Gothic, and about 100 yards from the metro.  The Ramblas is noisy all the time, but the hotel is a haven away from that.  \n\nThere's a small roof terrace with honesty bar so you can sit in the sun and enjoy the world going by.  Breakfast is served downstairs and is very nice (typical European - fruit, breads, cheese and meats, and fresh eggs cooked to your liking each day).\n\nWe thought it was brilliant = exactly what we needed",

I would book this hotel again, without a doubt, if we were ever to visit again. Arrived early but Ramon and the team were able to get us up to our room, with a complimentary glass of bubbles for the journey. The reception team were a huge help in suggesting restaurants and must sees. The roof terrace is amazing, the music is a lovely touch. It's all the extra touches that make this hotel so enjoyable, the wine hours, the daily little gifts with lovely messages, the acknowledgment of a birthday, the consistency of being greeted every day. The place is a wonder. Thank you for a wonderful base for our holiday <3",
