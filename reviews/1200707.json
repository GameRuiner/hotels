Most definitely the staff at the front desk, Omnia as well as the others were very helpful. \nThe housekeeping was so so helpful and were on their toes to make sure the room was all cleaned and made sure everything was refilled! I would like to personally thank Philip, Surinder and Imran at Grandeur hotel, for making sure everything was perfect for us! Loved it! Definitely recommend the hotel for everyone visiting Dubai. The location is perfect and you get access to local food, supermarkets that are hugeeee and perfume stores that are so reasonable you won’t have to travel anywhere else! The mall of emirates as well as the metro is just a 10 minute walk! Awesome! Thank you once again to all the front desk and housekeeping and the security! \nP.S. they have live music everyday by wonderful singers like Salman and Neetu being two of them. \nAlso they have a pool table and bar for all the party animals where they have live music too! It’s amazing!",
