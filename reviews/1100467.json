WHERE ARE THE CLEANERS, JANICEMEN?!\nI go to the reception and the man says to me, this is on the 6th floor, right?\nTotal disaster, YOU KNOW YOUR FLOOR IS FLOORING BUT YOU DON'T HAVE WATER PURIFIERS DOWN YOU DIDN'T SHUT OFF THE WATER THEY WERE FLOWING FULLY NO ONE FIXED THE ISSUE?!\nNO ONE EVEN CALLED ME TO TRY TO SOLVE ANYTHING!\nAnyway, they have a universal card and could open the room and just pick up what's on the floor?!\nThe adapters were in the socket, and the cable was in the water, good thing there was no electric shock!\n\nEverywhere you turn, you come across empty ears.. they offer a cleaning service for rags.. they change the room.. when I get to the room, the bed linen is brown from what?! Clean sheets?! And I should wash T-shirts in this dry cleaner (and I'm not bragging, I'm just saying), which are also of a higher price class.\n\nNone of this would have happened if they had changed my hotel, as I asked in the morning, or if they had at least called a man in the hotel to water his room!\n\nThe hotel was presented as better than average and the food average, we wanted to go to another hotel, but we were told that this one was better, so we immediately decided on this one without any prior inspection (I know my mistake)..and as I said before here realized the mistake and wanted to pay extra for a better hotel.\n",
