      "text": "Our visit to Antalya started on a bad note as our luggage didn’t come from Istanbul. We finally checked  into Megasaray Westbeach without our baggage and sleep deprived (red eye!!) Thankfully the staff at the reception was kind enough to give us a room early. Our expectations were not very high as we found a tray of rotting fruits in our room. They immediately changed it though. \nWe kept following up with the airlines for our luggage and the guest relations desk were very helpful. They even called the airlines on our behalf. A big shoutout to Sadaf at the guest relations desk who went out of her way to help us till midnight and we finally got it. She even helped us plan a day trip to the old city. \nThe rooms are comfortable and the restaurant and bar are very welcoming. \nThe spa is very relaxing. Great hammam and  massages. The hotel has daily entertainment activities and we specifically enjoyed the quiz night. \nThe overall experience at the property was amazing.. they made sure we were well looked after. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning their trip to Antalya!",

The buffet is bountiful, and most of all it’s healthy, I’ve stayed in other 5* hotels and the buffets have been mainly junk food, but Megasaray offers a lot of meat, fish and vegetables so you can be full and also in good health. The spa facilities is amazing, I definitely recommend the massages and Turkish bath and relaxing in the sauna/steam room as well. The bartenders are funny and very talented and make amazing cocktails, and let’s not forget that the hotel has its very own patisserie where you can grab a hot or cold coffee and cake. The entertainment is great and honestly I will definitely come back as this hotel is the closest place to heaven. We love you Megasaray, Yasmin & Kim.",
