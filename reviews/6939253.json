The food got a little bit repetitive but this happens at all inclusive resorts and we aren‚Äôt fussy so we were happy. \n\nMini waterpark was good fun and breaks up the ‚Äúlazy sunbathing days‚Äù for a bit of a thrill. \nNight club for adults was also good fun and we met a couple from our small home town which was crazy!\nEvening entertainment was really good, from bands to dancers!\n\nWe paid ‚Ç¨120 for a double jetski for 20 minutes. \nWe thought this was pricey but we wanted the experience and as beginners we were glad we did! Very fun! \n\nOnly thing we were disappointed with was the Starbucks, it was only open for a couple of hours in the day and the queue was always very long so we never waited.",

      "text": "We spent a week here all inclusive with another couple. We lucked out with a large room with sea views. It took us 2 days of mentioning to reception that our shower was a mere trickle. When the man came to look at it he 'unblocked' the flow and it was then fantastic.\n\nWe spent every day on the beach, the cabanas were great. The ladies making the Turkish pancakes were wonderful and so hard working in the heat.\n\nWe were well looked after in the bar area by Mithat & Kemer who were lovely. The cocktails were hit or miss depending on who was making them.\n\nThe only thing that let this hotel down was the chaos in the dining room. The staff work hard but there isn't anyone there to help seat people. Nearly every night the 4 of us had to share a table with 2 strangers for dinner!\n\nThe food was good and there was plenty of choice, however layout could be better.\nThe Patisserie deserves a mention as the kitchen team produce amazing cakes every day.\n\nWe ate at the Turkish a la Carte which was a nice change from the main restaurant, so much more civilised.",

      "text": "Where do i start? Arrived Sunday 29th October. We arrived in time for evening meal, but to say choice was limited would be an understatement. Food got worse over the course of the next 2 days to the point where i considered taxiing into Bodrum town because of the limited choice of food and my two young sons struggling to find something to eat. We then got told the hotel is closing for winter the day we leave (Sunday 5th November) and they were catering for less people, hense the reduction in food choices. Probably the reason only 3 of the 7 kids slides were open due to lack of staff to safely monitor, though we were told it was because they had a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô. Mmm‚Ä¶to add that they closed access to all slides after 3rd November! We then thought we‚Äôd book into one of the A La Carte restaurants, but were informed that none were open for the duration of our stay over 7 day period. As the week wore on, things progressivley got worse in terms of hotel facilities. Something new would close everyday (Starbucks counter, mexican beach snack bar, kids entertainment was stopped on 31st October! kids club closed also closed‚Ä¶the list goes on). With all this, we have enjoyed the pools/beach, but by far the most annoying thing on this holiday, has been the business conferences held in the hotel. Whilst the food improved towards the end of the week because the hotel decided to cater properly with these people at the hotel, if we havent been walking through a building site whilst they erect/dismantle the stands for the conference, we have had to walk through the middle of business conferences (all high end medical professionals) to every meal and pool visit, getting some seriously odd looks as you can imagine! And quite intimidating for our young children. I get the hotel have to make some money at this time of year with the lack of holiday residents, but i would suggest doing one or the other! For anyone looking at this hotel, you will probably have a better experience visiting June-September. End of season is really not a good experience for holiday makers here, and we really dont feel we have got what we paid for. I wouldn‚Äôt entertain ever returning for an October half term again when myself my husband and my children were supposed to be enjoying quality time together. To add to this - having sent all this to Jet2, they couldn‚Äôt give a monkeys, so we will never book a holiday through them again!",
