      "text": "We stayed 4 amazing nights. I start from the day one, we arrived at the lobby which was not at a level of 5 start hotel but acceptable for a beach resort. Friendly receptionist who have given us all the necessary information.  \n\nThe room was very clean, partial view to both side of magnificent Dubai attractions, with a nice balcony to chill out.  Room facilities was awesome but honestly the bedding was not that comfortable as i have experience in other 5 star hotels. \n\nBathroom is fantastic, however water intensity should be improved as well as hot water. \n\nThe pool area and beach are marvelous in any terms, including facilities, chairs, towels and service. This hotel is from those rare resorts in the area where pool is close to the beach with fantastic view for photo-shooting. \n\nBreakfast variety were acceptable, but still have space to reach 5 star resort. The only odd thing was low cleaning service of the table, no coffee machine and with no offense but a black lady waitress who did not want to give the service which we do not know why as whatever we asked her she said ok but ignored! \n\nThe big black guy at the entrance was soooo friendly and kind. He was welcoming guest in a very friendly way and guiding them with passion. \n\nAll in all, i am afraid i did not stay longer!",
