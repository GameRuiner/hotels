      "text": "just let me express how outstanding the stay was in the Steigenberger Hotel Alcazar! My wife and I and our both kids (9 and 7y) were so excited about ALL what the hotel offered so nicely. Unbelievable great experience! The food of the main restaurant breakfast, lunch, dinner was delicious, extensive and fresh every day with great and so friendly service and support from the serving and cooking staff,-outstanding. In particular, Amoura served extraordinary delicious food. The service was superior without any exception for food serving, entertaining, sports and more. We cannot even emphasise this enough how kids are treated in your hotel, which is totally amazing and outstanding: the kids program every day, the kids animation, for kids show every night, the kids club and how much caring the staff was with the kids in general.  We never experienced so much sweetness and caring in a hotel just for kids. \n\nLast but not least, the (nearly) private pool we had with the direct pool access in our superior room was absolutely perfect experience.\n\nWe will definitely come back. 100% recommendation",

      "text": "We stayed for a week in March  and having visited Sharm over 15 times this hotel offered the best experience we have had in Sharm. The thing that stands out is the customer service. Every member of staff were polite in welcoming us and nothing seemed to much for them. Around the pool the staff would come again and again each day offering various drinks and services. The al la carte restaurants were easy to book and we tried all of them. The food choice was different in each venue and the quality of the food and service was top class. Our room was kept immaculate and the mini bar always exceeded our expectations. The pier is long but i enjoyed the walk a couple of times each day and even the security staff would wave or say hello each time I passed them. (There was even free snorkel gear to use if you fancied a swim).I walked along the sea front passing several hotels and it is clear when you get back to the Steigenberger that you are in a different class of hotel. We could get up, go for breakfast and pick a sun bed anywhere apart from the adult pool due to some selfish guests reserving them and leaving their towels on them prior to breakfast despite the signage stating no reservation of beds. We will be returning here very soon and due to our experience this could be our hotel of choice for many more visits. Thanks to every staff member that made our experience FANTASTIC.",

      "text": "Positives: The facilities are good, they have well trained staff in the spa and plenty of activities to keep children / adults entertained without leaving the resort. The quality of the food is good and there are plenty of a la carte restaurants of a good standard\n\nNegatives: The staff at the Almaza bar was very slow with their service, it took them an hour to bring the food, and when you highlight this, they just blame the kitchen. We booked our holiday with easyjet and the reception desk did not provide accurate information about the pick up time so we missed our transfer from the hotel to the airport. We went for the second time, and we realised that they were trying to avoid serving specific items such as avocado, strawberries and lamb chops, yet if you asked nicely / tipped them, they would suddenly become available. \n\nOverall, it's a descent resort but there are issues with the service, the communication of the staff (English is quite poor) and they charge $70 for checking out a couple of hours late, which I find is unnecessary given the kind of room rate per night, which is quite up there with the most premium resorts in the area. We probably won't be going here again, as there are far better resorts with much better service and english speaking staff, who are not providing a better service to those who tip them.",
