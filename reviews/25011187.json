The prolonged check-in time, lack of King size beds, noise disturbances, unprofessional behavior from staff, areas of the hotel being out of service, and unsatisfactory breakfast all contribute to a suboptimal experience.the decline in service quality since the change in ownership warrant a reevaluation of the hotel's rating. It seems there are significant aspects that need improvement to match the standards expected from a luxury establishmen",

      "text": "We stayed at this property along with 200+ guests for a conference. The rooms were incredibly spacious and the twin beds in my room were each a double bed. The bathroom was what stood out for me since it had a shower stall and a bath tub and was very spacious. The decor failed to impress. The food (breakfast) was average. The banquet halls were large but the pre function area was narrow. Overall the hotel had a distinctly vintage vibe in terms of the decor and I felt like I was entering another world when I walked in through the door.",
