We were able to walk everywhere from the hotel.  Our room was a deluxe garden room which was spacious with lots of light.  The hotel has an amazingly fresh breakfast buffet available with a vast selection of local items.  Coffee is amazing and is made with a real, fresh ground coffee (not a pod).  Would definitely stay here again.  Felt welcoming, safe and clean.",

There are so many hotels in Barcelona that it's hard to choose when looking online, but I can 100% recommend the H10 Casa Mimosa. The outside space is beautiful and offers a tranquil space that allows you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city at the end of a busy day exploring. The rooms are quiet, spacious and offer everything you would expect from a top class hotel.  Our flight home was cancelled last minute and we needed to stay another night, the staff were fantastic and managed to arrange another night without even needing to move rooms.  We will definitely be returning! ",
