      "text": "If you are looking for a home away from home, then this is for you. There is literally a Carrefour 247 convenience store, just 10 feet away. Proximity to Mall of Emirates is literally 5mins. The apartment staff are truly nice. There is a nice pool on the roof. Another added bonus is the bus from Dubai outlet mall that takes you to and fro absolutely free.  My stay was very good. The apartment gave us an extra bed at no additional charges. Rooms were very spacious and thankfully had no smell of smoke or food. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping our rooms clean.  I would come back again for sure",
