      "text": "Hi, My family and I are checked in at the Leonardo Royal Hotel Barcelona Fira on Saturday, March 30, 2024 around 5:30pm. We were greeted by two receptionists. We booked two rooms for our family of 5. We have three kids and my little one is 6 years old. One of the  receptionists told us that we needed another room because of our 6 years old. We were surprised with this request since this is fourth 4-star hotel in Barcelona area and no-one asked us such request before. We have been traveling around the world, stayed in many hotels, and this is only the hotel asked us to get another room because of our 6 years old.  We always pay for the room. When my husband shared his experience with that receptionist with an obvious disappointment, the same receptionist got very upset and shouted out really loud “this is not your country”. This is not a professional way of explaining the hotel policies. This is a pure discrimination, and I am very disappointed in the Leonardo Royal Hotels because of having such a rude and unprofessional staff member in the team. He treated my husband and my family very disrespectfully. We were in Spain to celebrate Easter, and this experience will be always shadowing our vacation, Easter, and  happy memories. \nAnother issue is while this hotel claims that they must follow the rules, I was given a room with a very strong smoke smell. It is a shame that they chase my 6 years old age to sell me another room, but not chasing people who smoke in the room. Very disappointing…",
