      "text": "\nMe and my daughter came to the hotel for a week to have a treatment related to my teeth at the extraordinary and professional clinic \"The Royal Dent\", which I highly recommend. \nI can admit that the entire staff, from the reception, cleaning ladies, night porter and ending with the restaurant sweet girl, was simply amazing. The hotel manager is kind and very helpful. He took care of every detail, asked if we were satisfied and if we needed anything. A manager who is interested in the needs of each client. He was always care and smiling. \nThe reception lady named “Buket” was also wonderful. I have never experienced anything so pleasant in any other hotel I have stayed in. The atmosphere was family and we felt very safe which was very important for me and my daughter. I \nwould also like to mention an important aspect : Rooms. The rooms are immaculately clean, cleaned every day by lovely ladies who took care of cleanliness and order and were always there to help. we ordered food from nearby restaurants and the entire staff did everything they could to help us. I highly recommend this wonderful, clean and well-kept hotel.\nThank you so much all for wonderful hospitality! I’ll definitely come back again ❤️",

      "text": "We had a really negative experience at this motel unfortunately. The motel staff were not courteous and often did not even acknowledge that we passed them at the front counter with a ‘hello’ or ‘welcome’. They certainly were not busy and observed to not even respond when we greeted them. It was noted that ‘English’ was a language of this motel, we cannot say that anyone was able to speak enough English to provide such service to report on their advertising. There appeared to be a lot of extra people (non guests) visiting staff members frequently and all of which gathered together talking, smoking and socialising at the front entry to the motel which was of more interest than guests. The room we stayed in was right beside the railways line and the trains passed very early in the morning and into the late evening. It was very loud in our room with this train noise and also dogs barking continuously throughout the evening. The carpets were heavily stained and the mattress of very poor quality and extremely hard. The doona/ bedding was not the same size of the bed and too small for the size of the bed. King Bed with Double bed sized linen possibly. The breakfast staff did not acknowledge guests either and motel guests had to search for coffee by taking their cups to the kitchen area to be filled. It reminded me of a school canteen line! We checked out early at a financial loss as we felt we were inconveniencing the entire staff just by staying there. I would not recommend this motel for a pleasant experience when in the area. ",
