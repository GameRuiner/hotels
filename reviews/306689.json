I booked for premium desert safari with Rayna and was assured of best quality camp but in the end, we were taken to 'Total desert camp' as the travel desk overbooked beyond capacity. The camp was really pathetic with cold food, accessibility and rude staff..I think this camp should be blacklisted by the hotel travel desk. Rest everything was good.",

We went as a family of 3 (3 year old toddler), location is excellent as it’s very central. \n\nBreakfast is average with very limited space as the restaurant is tiny, be prepared to stand a while if you go late. As someone with a toddler, this wasnt great for us.\n\nThe A La Carte served in boston bar &grill is amazing and not pricey, highly recommend. We had half board and it was nice to choose between lunch or dinner, some hotels dont offer this option so this was a nice touch.\n\nWe had an issue with our room and the hotel was kind enough to move us to another room same night. Many thanks to Adil and Mohsin at front reception for this.\n\nThe staff at the hotel are very good and friendly, Ariful in housekeeping was kind enough to help us set up in our new room and rooms were serviced daily which is nice.\n\nOverall I was very happy and would come back again.\n\n",
