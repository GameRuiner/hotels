      "text": "1.\tCheck-in/Check-out: 5/5\nYou are welcomed from the moment you step out of the car and brought to a concierge. No wait.\n\n2.\tRooms(cleanliness, amenities) 5/5\nSatisfied with the rooms and amenities.\n\n3.\tOn-premise restaurants: 5/5\nThis hotel shines here. They have a great selection in a “cluster” right by the entrance to the Aquarium.\n\n4.\tPool area: 0/5\nThe biggest disappointment with this. While the pool itself was nice, we have reserved a cabana and here is our experience: It started as a tranquil spa like music, where you could actually relax, read a book and maybe nap. After some 15-20 minutes, the music from three speakers above us started BLASTING. Now, forget about the volume. The songs were explicit. After bringing this to the attention of the hostess, she came back giving an excuse that the volume was the same everywhere across the resort. She did not answer the question why it got so much louder. No comments were provided to “great” playlists with cursing. Family pool, I mind you, not Las Vegas. If there was an option to attach file with F words in the songs, I would.\n\nThey have lowered the volume for a few minutes and then it came back up blasting. Forget about napping. Called the manager Dinshan (spelling?). Explained the situation. Zero action. He was useless. \n\n5.\tService/Other: 5/5\nThe fact that you can go to the Waterpark right from the hotel premises is very convenient. Recommend that.\nHowever, purely based on the pool experience as the experience was ruined.\nOverall weighted score: 4.0 out of 5.0\nNotes: \nWould we come back? Most likely not. There are hotels of the same price point where the guests feedback is actually listened to and acted upon.",

      "text": "Our Guest Room Valet , Noyon was wonderful. When on vacation you usually look forward to leaving your resort room and heading out, whether that be to the pool, exploring or for something to eat. However, Noyon made the trip back to our room extra special. Especially for our two children. Everytime we headed back to our room, normally as we left the lift we would wonder what he had been up to in our room. I’ll let the photos tell that story…….\nOn our last night we returned from the Motiongate theme park to find he had worked his magic yet again, again the photo of our bed will explain! \nNoyon, thank you. \n\nAtlantis the Palm, Dubai. \n\nLove from the Roz, Chris, Dexter and Mya.
