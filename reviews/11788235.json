      "text": "Affordable hotel offering breakfast (buffet) but very poor WIFI connection in the upper floors.\nThe hotel faces the main Train Station of Izmir (Basmane Gar) but you don't hear any noises of the trains because windows are double glazed. all the furniture and equipments in the room and in the bathroom are new.\nWe spent only one night in the hotel which is a short time to really evaluate it but to be honest the hotel personnel and Manager were very helpful and even allowed us to stay in the lobby after checking out and kept our luggage until 7:00 pm when we left for our night train to Konya.\nThis can be a good hotel if they fix sime WIFI repeeters in the upper floors.",

      "text": "Pro: great location beside Basmane train station, room quite spacious with beautiful direct sunshine and fresh air. Situated in quiet side of Basmane. Okay very basic Turkish breakfast to fill the morning ... with cold tomato soup :(. Somehow helpful staff. \n\nCons: although the hotel has certificate of safe tourism, it is not that clean and the dust settled everywhere. Internet is relatively slow. I stayed 4 nights and the last night there was no daily housekeeping. A little renovation and more cleaning will make the hotel better actually. No soundproof so I could hear my guest neighbor dealt on his business on the phone ...   \n\nAnyway, it is a very budget hotel: what you pay is what you get. If you will spend most of your day outside this hotel is ok.",
