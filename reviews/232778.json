      "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights. It is located right on La Rambla and was near many restaurants, the metro and shops. It’s in a busy area and we were warned about pickpockets but we had no trouble whatsoever. Barcelona is a big city and has same issues as other big cities but I did not feel unsafe. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. We had a nice room that was roomy enough for 3 of us, clean and quiet. They have a breakfast buffet which was okay, but most of the time we ate breakfast at one of the numerous places on La Rambla. There is a restaurant right next door to the hotel that served a great dinner and breakfast and you can access it from the hotel. Hotels in Barcelona are pretty expensive but this one was reasonable and worth a stay.",

Staff were very helpful and friendly, although we didn't use it there was a restaurant attached to the hotel.  Would have been 5 stars but our room was boiling hot (which didn't correlate with the outside temp). The AC or opening the window were both loud and didn't help we must have been next to the actual hotel boiler (room 220). To be fair we didn't mention it to staff who may have moved us. Also nothing to do with the hotel but if you've made it this far please avoid the outside seated bars on Las Ramblas most of them are tourist traps and will rip you off!",
