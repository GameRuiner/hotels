      "text": "I have never written a complaint about any hotel before, but this hotel has been the worst I have ever experienced. \n\nOn the day of check-in, we were required to pay €49.00 in taxes for a 5-night stay. Since we were tourists, we only had €100 banknotes and wanted to pay with a €100 banknote (we encountered technical difficulties that prevented our Visa and Mastercard from successfully processing the payment), so that we could receive €50 in change. However, the receptionist refused to accept the €100 banknote, claiming they didn't have enough change. When we asked where we could get change, she suggested restaurants. Unfortunately, we were already rejected by two restaurants at the airport. We felt helpless and disappointed by this unfriendly action. It's ironic that this happened in a 4 to 5-star hotel, considering that Barcelona is a popular tourist destination.\n\nDuring my stay, I lost some personal belongings and sought assistance from the receptionist. Unfortunately, I had to wait for two days for the manager to respond, and to my dismay, no one was willing to lend a helping hand. I requested to review the CCTV footage, but the manager only checked a couple of minutes when the housekeeper entered the room. When I asked for the footage during the time we were out, the manager rejected my request and even questioned if I had locked the door properly. This kind of service is unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, the weather during my stay was extremely cold, reaching single-digit temperatures. I was hoping to enjoy a hot bath in this supposedly \"4-star hotel,\" but to my disappointment, the hot water was out of service for 3.5 days. This added to my overall dissatisfaction with the hotel.",

This hotel has a swimming pool a hot tub and a very professional staff. I like the room but we didn't take breakfast because I like to explore my neighborhoods and eat local delicacies. The only problem with this hotel is that it's a little bit far from the metro station maybe four or five blocks. There's a mall nearby. The hotel staff is very helpful. This hotel cost me $150 a night when Coldplay was in town and that was a steal. Book the room ahead of time to get a better price. I like the room I like the stuff I like everything about the hotel and I would surely stay there again although I wish it wasn't so far from public transportation.",

      "text": "The hotel looked nice and had a nice bar, however that’s pretty much where my compliments end. There was always a long line at reception with one person working, the breakfast buffet had some pretty gross scrambled eggs, and mostly a variety of lunch meats, cheese, and fruit. The room was tiny. The bathroom has this weird half glass wall thing that does not block any water from flowing out of the shower. Every time I took a shower the bathroom floor was covered in water. And speaking of showers, the hot water only worked about 50% of the time. Also the elevators are slow and the one on the right had people stuck in it more than once.",
