      "text": "On arrival the male gentle man on reception was rude to us. \nIn the morning the cleaners was knocking approx 08:30 to come in and make the bed, even though they don’t change your bed until after 4 nights of using them, I believe the same with the towels. \nAlso knocked over and over the one day 4 times had to tell her we ain’t going out yet. \nOn my birthday they did give a free bottle of Prosecco  and knocked our door with it, the same the following day as was my boyfriends birthday \nWhen Checking out had to pay 35 euros city tax, which was fine with but when arrived back to our country they had tried taking it another further 2 times, so tried to get us to pay 3 times, only we had no signal due to us being on the plane it didn’t go through and it had came up as fraud in the 3rd time \nOverall is a nice hotel but no balcony \nIt is close to the station if wanting to go else where in Barcelona which is a plus \nDidn’t spend much time there, did try the 15th lounge floor bar cousins get it, will probably have to pay extra to gain access",

      "text": "I had booked a room in this hotel to celebrate my anniversary with my wife. Little did we know, they cancelled our reservation 3 weeks before our trip. They tried to take a prepayment from my card without prior notice, and as it was expected, my card blocked the payment as an unauthorised transaction and, almsot immediately, we got an automated cancellation email for our reservation. I provided authorisation and emailed them back as soon as I found out (within 5 minutes) and they responded a day later saying that they can't take the cancellation back and they're now fully booked. Never had such an experience before, especially with a 4 star hotel. It's been so distressing trying to find alternative accommodation last minute in busy Barcelona. If you want peace of mind with your holiday plans, do yourselves a favour and book somewhere else!",

He was rude, racist, and threatened to call the police on me as I was on the phone with Expedia to remove me from the hotel after the housekeeping went through my items twice. \n\nI told him that I did not appreciate how he was speaking to me, and he told me he didn't care. His staff beneath him was just as rude and unhelpful. Emphasis on his staff member Laura.\n\nMy room door would not properly lock, and could be opened without a door key. Then they moved me to a smoking room. Then after being moved, the housekeeping went through my things twice. I complained about it multiple times, and they did not care.\n\nPLEASE, do not stay here. You will be in danger, and you will be treated like you are less then. To be treated like I was a criminal was so disheartening, and literally this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at globally.\n\nDO not stay here. I beg of you.",
