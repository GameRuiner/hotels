      "text": "We travelled as 3 friends and shared a room. We had 1 king bed and a double sofa bed. Toiletries & towels were included, alongside tea & coffee. Excellent location - just a 2 minute walk to the Urquinaona metro station! We arrived 1 hour early before check in & our room was already ready so the gentleman on reception kindly checked us in. Although please be aware that you will not see staff members regularly, and make sure you read and understand the check in details before you arrive. The communication between WhatsApp was excellent & they are always happy to help. The room could have been cleaner - some splash marks alongside cupboards & towel hooks in the bathroom were loose, however did not effect our stay, just minor details to bear in mind. I also lost my bag but the staff were amazing at getting it back to me in time for my flight home.",

      "text": "Stayed here for 10 days in July 2023. We had a room with a king bed and a pull out couch for three people. We had 0 issues with entering Sonder. The app was very easy to use. However, the app was not accurate about the locker luggage storage. In the app it says it is not available at this location yet is is. The lobby that you enter in has the luggage storage and a water station for free to fill up reusable waters which is nice. \n\nWe did pay for early check in and the room was not ready when we got there. This was a bummer after traveling all day. They said they would refund us the $40 early check in fee. \n\nNote there is no people working at this hotel physically. All communication is done remotely through the app. \n\nUpon first entering the room it is your standard hotel room. Nothing special but seems to be okay. Inside the room there is not a lot of storage. There is one standing shelf unit for you to hang your clothes in with a safe in it. There is also  mini fridge if you request it which we did. The king size bed was comfortable enough however note that they do not change the sheets during your stay. In the app there is a button to request a cleaning but then once you click on it, it says it is unavailable for this location.\n\nThe pull out sofa is very hard to pull out. Once out the metal bar that supports it can be felt every-time you sleep on it. Not comfortable at all.\n\nNow, to get to the worst part. Throughout our stay one of us kept getting bug bites and we weren't sure from what. Well on the later half of our stay we found a massive spider in the middle of the night in the pull out bed. We also found four cockroaches in the bathroom during our stay. We were on the first floor so they have easier access but it was still unacceptable. We did complain to the company via the app and they did refund us our last night. \n\nOverall I would not recommend staying here in the future. Book a hotel nearby instead. ",
