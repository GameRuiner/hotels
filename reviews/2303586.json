      "text": "The hotel exceeded our expectations, the staff were brilliant, especially our room cleaner Mina, what a lovely helpful man who went above and beyond. \nWe had an amazing room with a beautiful sea view, big comfy bed! \nThe food was great, we ate most nights in the main restaurant, each night was a themed night, so Indian, Italian etc. There was always plenty and really tasty for mass catering! \nThe 2 sisters from wales who worked in the entertainment team really worked hard to get people involved in their events, and were really helpful for local knowledge.\nWe used the free shuttle bus to soho square and Naama Bay, that was really useful to have a break away from the hotel and a change of scenery.\n\nThank you for a wonderful stay, I would highly recommend.",

Staff at all bars gave great service, especially the bar man at the beach bar, swim up pool and the two at the elements restaurant. No queuing at the bar drinks brought to your seat/ sun bed.  Food was lovely plenty of verity, enjoyed the Indian and BBQ restaurants as well as the buffet. Amazing coral reef off the jetty great snorkelling. Went on the sandy beach trip great service here too all drinks and lunch included and service as good as at the hotel. Great service also from the towel attendant who saved sun beds in our favourite area for us each day. Hotel was spacious with lots of areas to choose from, no where ever felt crowded. Would definitely recommend to anybody.",

      "text": "I love this hotel. For me, it is almost perfect. The rooms are large and very clean. The showers are deceptively powerful but the towels aren't very big - but I like to bundle up, so that's more of a personal opinion. The air conditioning in the rooms are brilliant, especially as my husband and I like to sleep in as cold a room as possible. Mini bar / fridges are provided but at an extra cost, but they still have enough room to stash your own drinks. TV's in the rooms have USB slots and i heard a few guestsbought theirfire sticks from home. Our cleaner would leave lots of different kinds of towel art on a daily basis and the room was spotless.\nThe food is a little repetitive but we always found something to eat and it was always fresh and plenty of it. The restaurant staff were great and friendly. Siad, the Yousiff's and Mark are the ones that we came into contact with most often.\nThe waiters in the bars, again are amazing. Always zooming about delivering drinks with lots of friendly chat. I cannot speak highly enough of Shady and Carlos.\nWe spent a lot of time at the pool with the swim-up bar and Matta, always had a smile and a kind word, every time we collected our towels from him. My husband likes the shade, and Matta would ensure that the parasol was moved as soon as the sun started to hit his sunbed - often before we had even noticed. Kiro at the bar was kept busy making sure all the guests were well hydrated but never too busy to give a smile or a chat.\nThe entertainment team. I don't know where to start. From morning to night, Talia and Amy didn't stop. The brilliant thing is that you could join in with as much or as little as you wanted- and there was a lot of different activities on offer. Gentle stretching and yoga, aqua gym, water polo, pool Olympic games, water polo, music quizzes, mini disco for the kids, trips to clubs (Pacha was very popular) and cocktail games. The Easter Day pool party was great fun. These two women were always around and always smiling. No small feat when you work out the hours that they work. They are a real credit to the hotel.\nI did overhear a couple of people complaining about how loud the music was, but when there are 6 pools to choose from, as well as the 'beach\", I thought that was an unreasonable complaint. Especially as they had chosen sunbeds right next to the speakers. I had no issues with the noise level, only that the DJ played the same songs every single day. I asked him to mix it up a bit, which he did, but only for 30 minutes.\nThe snorkelling off the jetty was amazing and I think I saw a more varied amount of fish here than on any of the trips that I went on.\nThe hotel provides free travel on a mini bus a few times per week to Soho Square, Old Market and Naama Bay but they book up very quickly but if it's fully booked you can always find a taxi outside the hotel.\nWe only had cause to speak to the reception staff a couple of times and they were always polite and helpful.\nI had a manicure at the Spa which I was very happy with. I was there for about an hour and it cost what would convert to £12.00. Bargain.\nI meant to go back for a massage as I had heard lots of positive things from other guests but I sadly never got round to it.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time again at this hotel and had booked to return later this year before we left.",
