      "text": "Long review, but well worth reading to the end if you are unsure whether to book or not.\n\nWe have just returned from 8 nights staying at the Bellagio Beach Resort and Spa.  We are a family with two children (12 year old and 18 month old) . After reading some of the reviews before going we were genuinely thinking about cancelling and we were really worried about what our experience would be like!\n\nFirstly, is it 5 star? Absolutely not, but its also not 3 star like some people have stated. The hotel on first impressions is beautiful, very grand and well kept and actually most of the communal areas are like this. The problems start to arise when you leave the main communal areas. We arrived at 1am and were taken to room 2212 in the annex building, a building that is not mentioned anywhere and we did not even know existed. These rooms have no lift access so we were required to walk up 3 sets of concrete steps (with plaster peeling off the walls, stains all the way up) with an 18 month old. There was absolutely no way this was safe and I made it clear we were not staying and the porter did not seem surprised, instead he was apologetic, clearly used to this reaction. He asked if we could just use it for the night and speak to reception in the morning,  and with it being after 1am we agreed. The room inside was dated, the shower didn't work properly, the air conditioning sounded like it was going to fall off the ceiling and there were birds nesting in the roof, so we did not sleep and I went to reception at 7am to ask to change rooms. This was no problem at all and we were given room 1347, in the main building, overlooking the pool and recently renovated. We did however, have to sign a waiver basically saying they had changed us rooms, we accepted the new room and they would take no responsibility for any further complaints we had...slightly alarming that they are going to those lengths.  I wonder why they are actually putting anyone in the rooms over in that building when they know they are so bad!\n\nThe new room we were put in was beautifully decorated, clean (although probably could have been cleaner, the floors were pretty dirty by the end of our stay so not sure how well they were cleaned) and spacious. However, there were still signs it hadn't been finished properly, for example a shower plate hanging off the wall, cracks in flooring and walls. We made the most of it though!\n\nThe pool areas were generally well kept and provided lots of entertainment for adults and children,  with a particular favourite being the water slides at the beach front pool. Be aware, the slides were only open from 10-12 and 2-4. The thing that let's the main pool area down the most is the hassle from people trying to get you to take trips, get a tattoo, go to the spa etc. On our first day we were approached by 5 different people in the space of 30 minutes.  If you are firm, they won't come back. Also please be aware around the pool area and the shallow end is really slippy!!! \n\nThe evening entertainment was varied and mostly well recieved by guests, the animation team definitely try hard.\n\nFood was always tasty and there would always be something to eat, however not for children in the evenings. The Happy Moments dessert bar has delicious donuts and its definitely worth booking the Italian a la carte as it was fantastic!\n\nAll in all, we had a nice time. Definitely not the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but some improvements really needed.",

      "text": "Lovely Hotel. Great service, would defo recommend and return myself.\nBefore travelling I was reading the reviews, they were so mixed, Some said it was excellent others not great at all. So I emailed the hotel to question if my room had been renovated yet as a lot of the previous reviews made comment about the construction Works, I was keen to make sure I avoided any issues and ensure I was in a good room. The hotel advised my room hadn’t been renovated yet but was in a lovely location but would ensure I was happy when arrived. So I went with an open mind.\nOn arrival. The check-in desk staff were very helpful. I was able to review the swim up room I had booked and an alternative. I ended up keeping the room that I booked. The location was lovely and the outside space was perfect.  the room could’ve done with a splash of paint, but it was clean and very comfortable.\n\nMy room was lovely and every day the housekeeper made a different animal from the towels, which is a lovely surprise to come back to.\n\nI visited all three à la carte restaurants the dinners were amazing, you definitely have to book. my favourite was the Italian, which I went twice.\nI did try the buffet but to be honest it needed some variety as I felt it was very much repetitive and limited. In the mornings I would have a freshly made omelette, but once again the other options were limited. The food was nice the place was clean and the staff very friendly.\n\nSo let’s talk about the cocktails, we all know alcohol abroad, can be hit and miss. But I can truly say the barmen at the Bellagio Did not fail! One evening I requested something rum based strong and sweet I couldn’t tell you what the drink was called, but it was delicious. That was then my drink for the week.\n\nOne thing I would recommend that you definitely do is attend the Spa. I ended up doing three days spa package. This holiday I needed to rest and I planned to do at least one spa experience. However, once I had taken a tour of the Spa and heard the different options, it was a no brainer to have three days of relaxation. I had the Hamam and head and body massages to unwind and get the best out of this holiday. The Spa was five star service was amazing, I left feeling like a new person.\n\nEntertain team was good, very small team, but kept everybody happy. I booked a couple day trips, was great and easy to arrange. \n\nThe staff were all friendly and helpful.",
