      "text": "This hotel caters to tour groups so it's often very busy in the lobby & restaurant and noisy. \nThe included breakfast was okay and there was variety. The restaurant menu was good, service was excellent and the pasta meals quite delicious.\nThe room had comfortable beds but the AC did not work despite the technician advising it did.  27C (80F) room temperature was unacceptable & ruined the overall experience at this hotel. \nThe hotel is centrally located however since we were only here for the tour to Ephesus a good sleep was more important than location.",

The location of the hotel is really good, it is close to the tourist areas and there is access to all public transportation, and there are many shops and restaurants around the hotel. The size of the rooms are suitable and clean, the equipment of the rooms are sufficiently charged every day. The minibar was empty and did not even cool, the air conditioner made a loud extra noise. The reception gave guidance as much as they could, but they were not fluent in English. The quality of the breakfast was average and there was not much variety during the week",

      "text": "We stayed there for a night and we were utterly disappointed by the rooms, service, breakfast everything. What can go wrong in a hotel, ACTUALLY HAPPENED !\n1. The rooms we recieved the AC wasn't working - room temperature was 30Â°C, the manager was unhelpful and kept telling we would check, we would check - nothing happened. Technician came but even he dint understand anything. \nSo finally we had to change the room, the manager asked us to see rooms first before shifting (we did their work by checking rooms, as they themselves weren't aware which room the AC was working or not)\n2. We checked close to 8 rooms wasting 3 hours of our time after reaching the hotel and got a room which max cooled to 27Â°C, manager told he wud provide us a table fan - but that too wasn't working\n3. Service - we had 2 medium sized bags, 2 small bags. The bellboy says, I am working alone so I can't take the luggage all by myself, u have to help me. If u don't not possible to move 4 bags by myself. Seriously, does it go that way !\n4. Electricity issues - while having breakfast in the morning, there was no electricity. 8t came back after 1/2hr, so we ate our bfast in the dark\n5. Safe box - I kept my valuables in it and closed it. But it dint open. I had to struggle to connect with all the hotel staff, he technician told - the safe was a problem, why did I put my valuables in the safe. Well then what's the purpose of the safe ðŸ¤”\nThe manager Geyzah was unhelpful, un-co operative. She dint do anything to solve our problem. While whatever help we got was from Mr. Ali, who did everything to make us feel better\n",

Breakfast and dinner were good, but the coffee at breakfast was awful. In the bathroom there was everything we needed - shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body milk. There were slippers too.  The location is great â€“ it is close to Basmane Gar, the historic part of the town, Kemaralti Market bazar, clock tower, Konak pier. The staff was very kind and helpful.
