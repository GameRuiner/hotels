      "text": "Its a 2 star hotel with good staff and kitchen facilities. We booked 2 bedroom apartment. The rooms are dirty and smelly. Many equipments are broken such as fridge, shower. The breakfast is very limited with just 4-5 options. The whole ambience look very outdated and need refurbishment. The swimming pool is always out of order.\nThe good points are reception and clock room staff are very good. Samita and Jagdish are very helpful. Overall most of the staff is always ready to help the customers. But the management really need to improve the condition of the rooms and the breakfast. The main advantage of this hotel/apartments is it has kitchen facilities which is useful if you want to prepare your own food. The location is very good. There are many restaurants nearyby which is open 24 hours. The metro station is just 5 min walk.",

The staff us very unprofessional and rude .specially the hotel manager who is a lady is very very arrogant and not service centric  . Staff is not guest friendly.  The lady manager showed a lot of negative attitude and had an threatening tone for everything. The hotel is not maintained properly.  Rooms are not cleaned on a daily baisis . Guests are treated badly . I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel ever. It's not value for money and leaves a very bad taste due to the staffs and managers behaviour",
