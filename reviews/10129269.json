      "text": "Merkez Oteli is a new hotel in Izmir with very well designed bedrooms, which have character, elegance and cosiness. It is situated between two supermarkets. Basmane Gar/Train Station and Basmane Corapakki Camii/Mosque are within walking distance. Cemal (Manager) and Nedim are pleasant and helpful. Wifi is available throughout the Hotel and it is cleaned on a daily basis. Breakfast is only basic and there is no lift access. Highly recommended for it's ambience and reasonable price!",
