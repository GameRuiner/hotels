The small plunge pool on the rooftop is nice, but unheated. So not for everyone! All in all, very good. Plenty of restaurants and cafes near by, so didn’t try the hotel food.",

      "text": "This is an excellent hotel in an ideal location. 3 minute walk to the metro station. 4 mins walk to Las Ramblas. The hotel is clean and we had an ideal interconnected room which was ideal for a family of 4. The rooftop pool was stunning with an incredible view. Sadly the pool was too cold in March to swim in. The only negative I have is the AC in one of the rooms went down to 19° and we wanted it to be cooler. This was reported to reception but the problem wasn't rectified. Not a major issue but would have been nice if they rectified this as promised. But overall very satisfied and will definitely book again. ",

The room inc bathroom was ample with a good size shower. We loved the clear signage on everything. The position was quiet and felt safe. The roof terrace was great and if it had been a bit warmer we would definitely have enjoyed a dip in the pool. Our room rate included breakfast which was good with plenty of choice. Efficient, helpful, and cheerful staff throughout. I only have one very, very minor suggestion (not criticisms), please add an entertainment TV channel in English. The only English speaking channel was a news channel I'd never heard of. After walking the city sights all day I'd have appreciated a bit of telly before heading out for the evening. The bag storage was a great bonus and saved us dragging our bags around with us after checkout, allowing us to enjoy a whole extra day.",
