      "text": "Nice location close to Casa Battlo and within walking distance to many restaurants and nice areas.  Fun and unique boutique feel with friendly employees.  Nice happy hour with free drinks, but no snacks this year.  No breakfast except muffins.  There is a restaurant next door with pretty good and reasonable breakfast, but they don't open until 8am.  For a hotel that prides themselves on good scents, it was a bit ironic that there was a slight odor in the bathroom.  Overall a very good experience, but there is a slight tradeoff with conveniences of big established hotels compared with the boutique hotel.",

We had the entry level room which was small, but we managed and the bed was comfortable and the air condition worked well. We slept amazingly well given its location near the Passiege del Gracia and found it quiet. We enjoyed our stay. Whilst there were a few minor drawbacks, as in we did not get the advertised room upgrade as it was very busy, the happy hour was hammered by a few and the snacks whilst provided were basic, for us the benefits were greater than a few hiccups. I would return but get a larger room. The coffee was welcome and the pastries were ok although repeated which made it boring. The lounge area is a nice comfortable place and the outdoor area lounges were pretty, with nice lighting. Housekeeping staff worked hard. The room decor was simple, comfortable clean and modern. The shower however spilled over into the room which was a design flaw  and annoying. ",
