      "text": "This hotel is amazing. The facilities are fantastic, the location is perfect with incredible views and we had a very relaxing holiday.\n\nAs for staff, they were all kind and helpful. The entertainment team were friendly and organised fun events. The shop attendant in the mini market was always polite and kind. The waiting staff in the restaurant outside seating area were always attentive and provided fast service. \n\nThe sun bathing decks were right on the cliff with the most beautiful view of the mountains, and have two direct entrances into the sea. We spent most of our holiday relaxing here and it was idyllic. \n\nWe went in April, and I would definitely come back at this time again as the hotel was fairly quiet, with lots of sun beds available to use and very short queues for food.\n\nThe hotel is also close to the old town, with a variety of shops, bars and restaurants. Thanks to the guest relations manager; she gave us good directions and recommendations for the old town. There was also a fair and market in the park close by when we went, with lots of authentic Turkish food and gifts.\n\nOur room was spotless and very spacious, and the added extras in room were appreciated. I noticed around the hotel there were also books that you could borrow, a nice extra touch! \n\nAnother thing I liked - there was a mini cat hotel outside where the stray cats could sleep, it was adorable! Nice to see how well they were looked after. \n\nThank you for such a relaxing holiday. If I could give 6 stars I would!\nIt was our first time in Turkey, and we will happily return to Antalya, and the Ramada Plaza.",

The only good thing was the diverse  breakfast and dinner menu at the hotel. Don't expect any courtesy or guest relations - they might as well charge you for sitting in their waiting lounge areas.

        "text": "Dear Anismita G,\nThank you for your feedback.\nWe have been serving as the Ramada Family for years without compromising our 5-star service quality.\nEven though our hotel room types are different, our approach to our guests and the service we provide are always the same.\nAfter booking an economy room type, we help our guests who want to change it through a complaint by examining the source of the problem.\nWe're just trying to enforce our rules. As in every hotel.\nFor this reason, there is no such thing as a sitting fee.\nBest Regards;\nRPA",
