      "text": "Going on an all inclusive holiday and staying at a hotel resort is supposed to be a pleasant experience. However, when the room was physically dirty, the service was horrendous and the amenities were lacking, definitely not the 4 star hotel that was described on the loveholidays advert. First and foremost, upon entering the room, we were immediately struck by the unpleasant smell. It was musty and stale, as if the room had not been aired out or cleaned in weeks if not longer. We had to move the beds together as we were given two single beds and there was dust and dirt all over the floors where the bed had clearly been for a long period of time. We were even moved rooms due to the to the pure uncleanliness of the first one we were given only for the second room to be just as bad. The bathrooms were horrific. Our hotel room also had no running hot water for our entire 7 day stay so we were given a kettle to boil water for our 1 year old sons baths. There was also no cot provided for our 1 year old even though we rang up prior to arrival and was told this would be set up for us considering our plane didnâ€™t land until 8pm. We immediately complained to management and the staff claimed that there unfortunately wasnâ€™t one available at the moment and they would resolve the issue the following morning so our son had to sleep with us. They then proceeded to tell us they didnâ€™t have any travel cots left so the cot would be wooden so we agreed. When they brought us the cot on the second day it was moses basket size and couldnâ€™t fit a baby in it older than 3 months our son is 16 months old. We had to make do and make our son a bed on one of the sofas which he slept on for 7 nights. Absolutely appalling considering they were aware we were coming with an infant and we had rang the hotel prior to arrival. In addition to the condition of the room, we were also disappointed with the services provided. It took hours for management to come and speak to us and they never actually resolved any of our issues during our whole 7 day stay. We had no cot for our son, no hot water and limited food even though it was supposed to be all inclusive board. Surely this is the bare minimum. The staff do not speak English so we found it extremely difficult to communicate with them and often had to use a translation app on our phones to pass on simple messages. The staff seemed unresponsive and uninterested in providing prompt and efficient resolutions. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a communication issue or they were genuinely ignorant and unwilling to help us. Finally, we were disappointed with the amenities provided. we were also disappointed with the services provided. The hotelâ€™s description states that Italian and seafood meals are served in the a la carte speciality restaurant. However, there is only one place to eat with limited food which is very poor quality. Also if you donâ€™t get to the food hall when they start serving they will run out of food and they donâ€™t make anymore. The staff wait for you to eat and then eat themselves. For example the breakfast was between 7:00-10:00 but if you got there at 9:30 there is nothing left. There was also no tv lounge, hot-tub, sauna, spa centre or massages available. Alongside, no volley ball, table tennis, darts, or a billiard table. Also no entertainment for adults or children and no Kids club at the resort. They also advertised having a British sports bar and pub which is untrue. The sports bar is privately owned by an English couple but itâ€™s not part of the hotel itâ€™s down the road so you have to pay for it. The Wifi barely works and is constantly being turned off and on all day. The description of this hotel provided by Loveholidays is false advertisement and is not a reflection of how the hotel is or actually looks. False pictures and amenities. I also do understand that some of the amenities would cost extra money but they are simply not even available. Please save your money I am so glad to be home.",

      "text": "As a personal experience somebody enter in my room with master key and stole form my suitcase 2 dirty pants and 200$ (Dirty underwear was in specific bag) so the person touch all my stuff and took most like itâ€¦ \n\nIn photograps all hotels look nice and make sense choice 4 stars hotel for good prize when you dont know anything more. But the reality its differentâ€¦\n\n-Aquapark its working half hour per day\n\n-At 10am music start like in a nightclub volume, so not posible sleep after 10am, rest, or take a nap in all day\n\n-Music its same 10-15 songs all day, so after 3 days your mind can explote to hear same and same music without option to rest in your room coz music its to loud. \n\n-Buffet foodâ€¦ totally disgusting, very poor food, just instant coffe and milk powder for drink. Not normal coffe, not normal milk, not orange juice or teas. Not fresh bread, not fresh croissants. Photographs they put its not the reality \n\n-For go beach need go by bus, the hotel its not next to the beach. the beach of hotel its totally poor and dirty, chairs and umbrellas all broke. Its like abandoned beach not same than you can see in pictures \n\n-Local people know the ways to enter in hotel and they try to steal items like wallets, clocks, swim clothes if you leave outside to dryâ€¦ anything they found. Its not high unsafe but its not confortable for stay on hollidays in this situationâ€¦. \n\nAt the end its not good deal prize for 4 stars hotel. Just its beautiful photograps that doesnt match with reality but the people cant know it before than arrive.",
