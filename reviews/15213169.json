      "text": "Overall the stay was excellent. Gorgeous hotel and excellent staff. Pool was lovely and lifeguards aplenty. \n\nHowever there was a real lack of options with the buffet food and it was nearly the same for 8 nights. There was also a real lack of options for young kids. No fresh food cooking stations either which was surprising. Saying that, the quality of the food there was, was excellent. The music entertainment was the same for all 8 nights. I would have just expected much more variety from such a reputable hotel. \n\nI also had many queries on the bill at check out. Again not something I would expect from Raffles. I had almost AED1000 of charges that shouldnâ€™t have been on there.",

      "text": "We stayed at the hotel for 10nights, everything was perfect. Thats the most amazing holiday experience we had so far. \n\nWe stayed at the suite with Jacuzzi, very spacious room, absolutely beautiful,elegant design, large balcony, wonderful views and privacy. We enjoyed the 6th floor club experience very much as well. \n\nThanks to hotel manager Mr Aaron Kaupp, who wrote the lovely message in the room card, I also took it back home , it will remind me of the lovely experience in the future. Thanks to the manager at the club, who greeted us with a lovely smile every time, and printed out all the club information for me. Also thanks to restaurant manager Hani, one day my daughter was ill and stayed in the room, Hani offered us the room service breakfast, it was nicely arranged and sent to our room quickly. Thanks to our butler, one day my daughter was ill, and needed a hot water bottle, just a phone called, it was sent to our room quickly. Thanks to the housekeepers who were very polite and cleaned our room everyday. \n\nThough evening meal buffet were almost the same every night as Ramada, but it was acceptable, we tried one night at the hotelâ€™s Italian restaurant, very nice food there. \nWe loved the food served in the club 6th floor, healthy options, not over cooked, and nicely presented. We enjoyed the happy hours there, nice and relaxing atmosphereI between 5-7pm where you could enjoy the sunset with unlimited cocktails and snacks, it was so so nice. And also I noticed you have some very good staffs( good memory) at main restaurant too, I ordered quite a few different teas, coffees, eggs, different requirements, but one staff remembered all of them (not even wrote it down) and quickly brought to us. \n\nOn the day when we checked out, assitant restaurant manager and another staff came to us asking our experience in the hotel. We felt that they really pay attention to every details and valued every customers' opinion. \n\nThank you for all of the staffs who provided us with those unforgettable experiences. Keep up the good work, we definitely will come back again in future.",
