      "text": "Stayed in a studio apartment. It was small, but had everything in it. The shower head was broken so it was difficult to shower. Also, during a 5 night stay, there was no cleaning, clean towels or clean sheets offered. We did contact the manager to get clean items, and he did so quickly. \nThe apartment I stayed in was just inside the main door. Because of this, it was quite noisy. \nThe apartments are in a very central area. There's a lovely park just 2 minute walk away. Also, the Kordon area of Izmir is about a 15/20 minute walk. \nLocated in an area that is central to public transport. The metro station, Hilal, is only 5 minutes away. \nOverall, enjoyable enough stay. ",
