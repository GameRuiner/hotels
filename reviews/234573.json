Very comfortable bed, and everything was clean. \nBreakfast was ok - the only thing I didn’t like was that they still use the little units of butter and jam in plastic containers.\n\nThe hotel is located super central, with a metro stop connecting you to further away places  just a 2 min walk away.",

We had to put a deposit down for a kettle (€20) and when we got it back to the room there was no mugs so didn’t end up using it. There’s no where to put your bags and no hooks for jackets. These simple things would make this of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in, for a city break before.",

      "text": "Great hotel. Voted 5 stars as I feel it was great value for money. It isn’t a 5 star hotel but it gets 5 stars for what it is. The location is fantastic, literally a minute from ramblas. Yes there are some homeless people in the vicinity, that being said they aren’t sat in the hotel door way. Also it’s a city, what more do you expect? The hotel can’t control where homeless people sit, not once did a homeless person come over and bother us either. It’s so close to ramblas that you have to expect pick pockets and homeless, that’s part of a busy city/tourist area. Rooms were clean, modern. Breakfast was a continental style breakfast, they had scrambled egg, hot dog style sausages and bacon. Anyone complaining that the food wasn’t ’full English’ style, well you are in Catalan. Exactly the same if England had tourists, the tourists would be served English food. It’s part and parcel of travelling and being in another county with their culture and way of living! I would defo stop here again, the location was its main pro! ",
