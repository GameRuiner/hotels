I wish we stayed longer.\n\nWe checked in late at night, and the young gentleman (with glasses on the 18th March for room 807)at the front desk, was so sweet , welcoming and friendly. This is what makes a hotel memorable. Staff that are like this. He said we got a free upgrade, and we had the most beautiful room.\nHe is an asset to the hotel….in case you read this.\nWe have travelled for a month now, and I can tell you , these people,e are few and far between.\n\nEverything was perfect in our room.\n\nWe were on the 8th floor , overlooking the plaza. Absolutely stunning!\n\nSo quiet. Air con. Great bed, amenities, etc.\n\nThe dinners was great, as was the breakfast buffet.\n\nPerfect location! Wonderful staff! \n\nCan not say enough good things about this place. Hope to come back again!",

      "text": "I stayed two nights then found out my mother died. I informed the hotel I needed an additional night and the response was. \n\nWe don't have any rooms at \"your rate\". You must book an additional three nights in order to be considered for another room night... Call the front desk in the morning.\n\nI had already stayed two nights.\n\nNot only did the front desk agent increase the rate BUT ABSOLUTELY NO ONE offered condolences. It seemed like a strong arm hustle. I never asked for a discount but the price gauge was ridiculous... I told them it was in poor taste... they didn't offer condolences and the unprofessionalism of forcing me to pay for three additional days when my flight was in less than 12 hours was a reason for me never to revisit this hotel.\n\nBooked my room using AMEX travel. Apparently they have a relationship with Experia for hotels. \n\nThe first day I checked in the woman at the front desk reminded me that I booked the room from Expedia and I would be given an \"undervalued room\" despite it being $300 per night.\n\nRelocated to this hotel. It's adorable, clean, modern and amid the pulse of the city.\n\nSTAFF\nWhen the woman thought I was African she was rude. She lightened up a bit when she realized I was a proud American. The woman at the front seemed to think she was doing me a favor by giving me a room with a view of the alley.\n\nENGLISH\nSome speak English. Menus are in English and Spanish. Room service staff was clean.\n\nLOCATION\nIn the heart of the city but the area is sketchy like most of Barcelona in my opinion. As a tourist, you may want to consider this area or E!xample. Train station is directly in front of the hotel. Taxis are available 24/7\n\nAMENITIES\nInternet lounge with potato chips\nWine\nNespresso station\nSeating\nComputer\n\nDINING\nCourtyard restaurant\nBar\nIn room dining ( only 10 items)\nNot a lot to choose from.\nFew vegetarian options\n\nShopping\nEverywhere you look is shopping. Located directly beside La Rambla where there's tons of shopping.\n\nSAFETY\nUse the safe in your hotel room to store valuables. Hotel is safe. The door man asked me if I had a reservation before he said Hello or opened the door which was pretty rude.\n\nPickpocketing and sketchy folks who stare. I'm a woman. Men make gestures. Stare back and give them the middle finger and they will leave you alone.\n\nTRAVEL WISELY\nBest to invest in a cross body bag placed in front of your body. Highly recommend a neck wallet. Leave your passport and valuables in the safe in your hotel room.",
