      "text": "I dont know where to start. The hotel wasnt definitely 5 stars, and I dont think its even 4 stars, because the food was not edible.\nThe room was dirty and moldy. Bathtub had some weird stripes in it, hairs and dirt. In a 3 person room we were given 2 water bottles a day for free and after getting back to the hotel room they try to give you more and expecting to get more money.\nHousekeeping woke us up 9 am to start cleaning two mornings in a row.\nThe entertainment team was very unprofessional by being touchy and rude. Constantly bothering you and pressuring u to do the activities that they are doing daily. When you say you are here to relax and do not wish to participate in their activities all day they say they hate you and wish you would never come back to Egypt and their hotel.\nThe entertainment that was offered in the evening also lacked a lot and was mostly meant for children.\nThe food was mushy and tasteless every day. Meat was always burnt or overcooked, and the only edible thing there were the fries which they always ran out of.\nI would never recommend it to anyone.",
