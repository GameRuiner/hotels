      "text": "Don't get me wrong, this hotel isn't a bad hotel, but a couple of things \"bugged\" me which i will mention after i have given you the plusses.\n\nI have been to Barca a few times, April last year with the lads on a stag party was one of them, and this year with my wife for my 59th birthday. For anyone thinking of asking the question, \"Isn't It Time To Grow Old Gracefully?\"......the answer is Yes, Yes it is...and i will do that.......Just not yet. (a thumbs up at the end of the review in agreement would be appreciated lads).\n\nLast year i stayed at the Silken Ramblas, which was amazing and right in the heart of Las Ramblas...this year....it was too expensive to stay there.\nThe Astoria had a similar pool on the roof (a small plunge pool, but still lovely), and a certain authentic charm, so opetd for it. I think we paid €145 per night for the room which was €50 cheaper than the silken's.\n\n++++++ (plus) Points\n\nStaff were very friendly and willing to help with anything. The older gentlemen who booked us in on 26th March at 11.00 a.m. was amazing. I don't mean any offence by calling him older, but didn't get his name and dont know how else to describe him. He appeared to be a gentleman of may age, and very, very much like myself...worth his weight in gold.\n\nHotel was spotless, authentic and very traditional. Marble floors, spiral staircase and that \"Oldy Worldy\" Spanish thing going on that a true historian would relish in.\n\nRoom was spotless, and cleaned every day. Large double window (about 5' across, that could be opened to fill the room with light and air, Awesome tbh). Power shower and toiletries.....and get a load of this.....Slippers.\nAnd to top it off......if the towels cost the hotel anything less than €100 each to purchase, they were a bargain....wow...never had such fluffy hotel towels.\nHair dryer, desk and case stand, and comfortable beds with an abundance of pillows... and there you have it......Your Mid Range Spanish City Hotel.\n\n _ _ _ _  (negative) Points\n\nIf you are after a quiet area of Barca, then this could really be for you. Its just off the \n\"Avenida Diagonal\", which basically cuts the city in half, which basically means......\nYour A Bit Out Of It.. The hotel is right at the top of the Ramblas, and if you want to walk to the bottom, where the port is... and the museums.... and the buzz....and your not used to walking.....and you don't want to rack up €40 per night/day cab fares.....\nUna Problemo\n\nSenor Gerente Del Hotel.....€18 for a breakfast is charged unless you sign up to eat for the week.....then it drops to €12. A disgrace my friend. They are your guests, they have paid to stay with you and the price of bread and jam is the same weather you have it one day....or 5 days.\n\nYou cant eat Dinner in the hotel. They will do a Brekkie, and they will do a lunch (€18 again which i think is reasonable for a lunch)).....But The Hotel Astoria Doesn't Provide An Evening Meal. First hotel i have had this happen if i'm honest....however...if its a Spanish thing or a City thing....My Bad.\n\nNo Kettle, No Brew Facilities........Again, i cant remember a City hotel room without the facilities to make a brew when you wake up. Possibly....very possibly...tea was on the room service at a tenner a pop, but cant say as i thought if they don't have the staff to do a dinner, may not have the staff to do a brew......dunno tbh.\n\nAnyways....not a bad hotel and not a great hotel, but wouldn't bother me staying here again.\n\nP.S......The hotel plug the restaurant Crosmus as a recommended Tapas restaurant by  stamping a card with the hotel logo entitling you to a complimentary glass of Cava on arrival........Its Baloney......We had the two glasses of Cava.....And Was Charged For both (see my Crosmas review).\n\nChiChin.....The Choice Is Yours",

It’s also true that our hotel currently does not serve dinner, but we are surrounded by a plethora of dining options and our helpful team are more than happy to provide recommendations if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, we apologise for any misunderstanding regarding the restaurant Crosmus and the discrepancy with the complimentary glass of Cava. We will be sure to investigate this to prevent any future confusion.\n\nNevertheless, we are particularly proud of our comfortable beds, fluffy towels, and comprehensive room amenities that include slippers, and it’s a pleasure to know these hit the mark for you. For any future stays, you’ll be pleased to know that coffee and tea facilities are available at the reception upon request.\n\nWe hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future for an even more enjoyable experience. \nWarm regards,\n\nPepe Camps, General Manager",

The doors were not sound proof at all. We could hear every movement in the halls, every door open and shut, and I found it very difficult to sleep without being woken up by someone inside the hotel or traffic outside",
