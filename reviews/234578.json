The hotel is right in the heart of the Gothic district, it‚Äôs surrounded by every type of bar and restaurant you will need.\n\nFrom check in to check out I had fantastic service, rooms were clean and modern, there is a fridge and a safe to use for free. There is a bar attached to the hotel which is reasonably priced too. \n\nWill return again for sure to this lovely hotel with friendly staff.",
