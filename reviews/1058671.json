      "text": "I was originally going to mark it as 1, but some redeeming factors exist.  It's also possible that being the last week of the season (at least for TUI) made things worse.\n\nI wish I had read all the reviews first. \n\nOne review was that the 'Friendly staff were fantastic, but the food was ...\nThe staff were great, but the food was bland and cheap.  Sunday's main meal had meatballs and chicken burgers as the meat options.   Mince can hide a multitude of sins. Breakfast was the same items.  The salads and desserts were the same every mealtime.\n\nThe Greek al a carte restaurant was not much better - warmed-up, dried, souvlaki sticks.\n\n'The worst all-inclusive I have been to...'\nCertainly would agree with that.  \n\nThe drinks were very poor quality.  I would describe the spirits as rotgut.  The wine was thin and too acidic for my tastes.  The beer was passable.  \n\nOn an all-inclusive there should be no need to go out with money in your pocket.   There seem to be charges for lots of things; cocktails and even ice-cream.\n\nWe have been to 8 all-inclusive resorts and this compares very unfavourably.  If I had been there with my family I would have left and changed hotels.  But this was a mates break.  \n\nLots of reviews say they had a wonderful time and that is correct as well.  Many people greatly enjoyed their holiday.  (We enjoyed ours.)  I would put that down to the sea, sand sun and good company.\n\nThe good elements - redeeming features.  The staff.  The room was spacious if a bit frayed at the edges.  The pools.  The snack bars.  \n\nI don't recommend.",

Our room was basic (2 single beds pushed together and a camp bed) . Bit awkward as we were all in one area. The camp bed was not comfy so we asked for another mattress/topper, which came as a double. I couldn't be bothered asking again so we just swapped the mattresses around and left the topper over the joined beds, it was however badly stained, the single protector was badly stained and a blanket was also dirty-makes me feel ill seeing other peoples filth on the bed i'm supposed to sleep in. No excuse for not washing these things. I have never known so many people smoking in one area, The only no smoking zone was inside, on a warm evening we didn't want to sit inside but struggled to get away from stench of fags. They could do with a smoke free section.(just a personal opinion) we were the minority.  The staff were polite, efficient, food was plentiful and generally we had a nice time.",
