      "text": "Located in heart of the small town of Sirince (which gets busy with tourists in the day) but quiet and peaceful in the rooms. Sirince is a fantastic place to stay - close to Ephesus but away from it all in the hills. The rooms are comfortable  with good beds, AC, and nice bathrooms. There is a tiny courtyard outside the rooms. It's a cozy small place with 4 rooms. The breakfasts at the associated restaurant across the street fabulous with more excellent food than we could ever eat, including five types of jam, fruit, veggies, breads, fresh OJ, coffee, tea and on and on. And best of all is Ali and his team. He was incredibly helpful, friendly, anticipating our needs and then some. His English is good, and we had some nice conversations.We \n\nAn initial mistake with our reservation - we asked by phone to add an additional night and Ali confirmed this on the phone, but when we arrived, no rooms were available. But Ali arranged for us to stay elsewhere for the night and then we moved back the next morning.\n\nWe can't wait to go back!",

      "text": "I just want to say a big thank you to the owner of Sakli Vadi Hikmet and his staff for making my weekends away in Sirince always special. After my first visit I've returned another 3 times with friends who have all loved it.  It's a beautiful location in the mountains only a short dolmus away from Sirince. There's some lovely walks through the hills. The rooms are pretty Swiss style cottage rooms. There's tasty home made food, delicious local fruit wines and we enjoyed a night of Turkish folk music and a fantastic Turkish village breakfast of organic home made jams, eggs from their chickens and local honey. yum!! Thanks from English teacher!",
