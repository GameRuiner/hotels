The reception was great and the gentleman from Morocco was very welcoming. \n\nHowever the rooms were rather ordinary. The area around the roof pool was not clean,  with spills on the tables and chairs. The half board arrangement at the in-house restaurant was rather disappointing in variety and value. The service was dull and slow. Its the first time at a Taj that we felt that their trademark hospitality was missing.",
