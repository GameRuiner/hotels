      "text": "We are 1 week into a 9 day stay. I have been to Egypt several times before, previously staying in larger hotels as travelling with children. I was a little wary after reading reviews here but I needn't have worried. Amar Sina has been a perfect getaway. It may be a little dated in places but the rustic charm far outweighs the corporate blandness I have experienced in larger hotels. The staff are warm and welcoming and will do all they can to make your stay as relaxing as possible. I will definitely return here without any hesitation. As we have met many returning visitors we are not alone in appreciating the opportunity to enjoy the calm, relaxing atmosphere the Amar Sina delivers. The staff are like one big family and all work so hard. The food is fresh and tasty, not a chip or chicken nugget in sight. ",

      "text": "Donâ€™t waste your money.\nFood is gross and pretty much the same everyday, Some days we got the same slop for lunch and dinner and sometimes even breakfast ! Thank God for the Italian restaurant down the road and the fabulous Naama Bay or we would have starved.  We ended up eating out 10 nights out of 14 and only bothered with 2 breakfasts as bread & omelettes were the only edible things  AI drinks are a joke. 3 very cheap soft drinks and 3 cheap spirits was your choice. No beer. Any drink was given in a very small plastic glass containing a couple of mouthfuls and the service of them was definitely not with a smile.\nFirst room we were given a vagrant wouldnâ€™t have stayed in. The second was better but still not acceptable. Old broken furniture, bad electrics, TV from the 60s and broken shower. Iâ€™m sure the room was really nice when it first opened 20+ years ago but like the rest of the hotel it has been badly neglected. The only saving graces were that the bed was very comfortable and the cleaners did a good job cleaning and supplying fresh bed linen, towels and bog roll\nThe pool and pool area was dirty and in need of repairs. One day they washed the area where the sun beds and parasols were and brushed the water into the pool ! There is nowhere near enough sun-beds and parasols for the amount of guests, not that the hotel was particularly busy and the sun beds were â€˜towelledâ€™ by 8am everyday. The animation team, was 1 person and he tried his best, but on some days there was literally no entertainment and there was zero at night. \nThere was a free bus laid on every morning and afternoon to take you to 1 of 2 beaches about 20 minutes away. The first beach was awful - cramped, no toilets and you had to walk up and down a hundred steep, dangerous and broken steps to get there. Definitely not suitable for kids, elderly or disabled. The second beach was better but the bus only went there at 2pm and picked you up at 5 so only 3 hours. \nThe location is not great either. There are a few shops around and one or 2 pay per day beaches belonging to better hotels but thatâ€™s about it. Thankfully the Old Town and Naama Bay are only a 20 minute taxi ride away to get away from the area. \nThere is a small, pitiful animal farm at the hotel, which should be closed down immediately. I felt so sorry for the poor, diseased & neglected creatures. At least the humans have a choice whether or not to stay at the hotel. \nIf you are staying here for one night then this is a cheap basic hotel and you probably wonâ€™t be too bothered with all the faults but if youâ€™re staying any longer, book any other hotel in Sharm, it couldnâ€™t be worse. It will be worth paying Â£200 or Â£300 more I promise you. I can only imagine that any positive reviews on this site are either fake or from overnight stayers.",

They stated that they had no facility for card payments yet they have the VISA card sticker on their doors. I had to book somewhere else urgently so that I had somewhere to go.
