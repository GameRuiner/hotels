      "text": "Hawaii vibes all round! Special thanks to the kids club with Tara, Judy, & Sadeepa making a difference with their smiles and offering kid-friendly henna tattoos and uno cards! The resorts selection of body wash, shampoo and lotion brand is impressive, premium, and available generously. The breakfast buffet is one of the best in Dubai. Grapefruit, Almond milk, protein bread, and niche selections for health-cautious guests raised our eyebrows and filled our cups without feeling guilty! ARI pool bar and dining is delicious! However, the resort is in need for more employees at the main reception to prevent long queues along with faster room service with proactive housekeeping can be improved for higher satisfaction. We will extend our stay and return every year without a doubt. Thank you Lapita!",

      "text": "Having stayed elsewhere in Dubai and enjoyed faultless accommodation and food, I was somewhat disappointed with Lapita, where it was undoubtedly a property aimed at those wishing to visit the theme parks. We are definitely not snobs or difficult to please however the rooms we had showed definite signs of being well worn and hand marks from kids were evident on windows and doors. The corners of units were chipped and reminded me of something we’ve now come to expect in a Disney property, which is a shame considering how hard the staff clearly work. Maybe they need more cleaning and maintenance staff or perhaps it’s just the standard of clientele? Maybe it’s the latter considering the conduct we witnessed from certain identifiable groups during meal times and at the pools. Entering the pools fully clothed towards the end of the day, undoubtedly to ‘rinse’ the clothes they’d been wearing all day in the sun and heat, then walking into the nearby restaurant during dinner service, barefoot, in nothing but swimming costumes (presumably their outer clothes were now drying), and dripping everywhere while more civilised patrons were trying to eat dinner. Their conduct at the buffet breakfast was worse, using the serving spoons to sample dishes, using fingers to eat directly from serving bowls (repeatedly from mouth to food), and totally disregarding the basics of simple personal hygiene when around food. Sadly, the staff were too busy clearing up after some really dirty and inconsiderate guests to address this conduct but it certainly put me off eating anything from certain areas of the buffet. While it’s true that the hotel isn’t responsible for the conduct of a few guests, when I consider what is available elsewhere in Dubai, I’ll be spending that little bit extra on any future visits and enjoying a leas Disney-esque resort with fewer uncivilized and unhygienic guests.",

      "text": "From our early arrival at 8am we experienced fantastic customer service.  Kids were welcomed with necklaces and we were offered a welcome drink.  Everyone all smiles.  We weren’t expecting to check in until later as we appreciated we arrived early in the morning but we were offered a ground floor pool room right away.  This was great after a long flight.  \nThe hotel is a group of buildings build around the pools so some closer to the main building/facilities than others.  We were allocated building 8 which was close to the main building and faced the main pool/ari restaurant. Room was big and spacious with 2x double beds and a big bathroom with huge bath.  \nWe were on a half board plus meal plan so our first evening meal we had at the main buffet restaurant and we were impressed with the large selection of food and how quickly the chefs worked to replenish the food. You are able to swap your evening meal for lunch if you would prefer.  The restaurant head chef also came around to check we were happy with the food and he was happy to cook us anything we fancied if not on the buffet.  \nThe half board plus plan includes: \nbuffet breakfast and buffet lunch OR dinner at the main restaurant or Halinki, \nfree soft drinks, tea or coffee from the cafe opposite the reception all day, \n1x free icecream per child per day, \n2x alcoholic drinks per adult per day between 6-8pm at the outdoor bar next to reception.  We did have to ask what drinks were included as there are no menus to advise but the ladies who worked on the bar worked hard and were very helpful and friendly.  During our stay it was very windy so we brought our drinks inside one day and we got told that we had to have these outside and weren’t allowed indoors.  We didn’t get a reason as to why but I guessed it might be because of Ramadan.  If not, then it seems a very weird rule.  We were able to drink alcohol at the table at dinner though.  \nWe enjoyed all food at breakfast and dinner at both restaurants.  Halinki was a smaller buffet and pan Asian at dinner and was more relaxed and less hectic than then main buffet. Breakfast gets extreamly busy from 9.30am onwards so getting there early is recommended.  Dinner gets busiest from 7.30pm so early or later is better.  \n\nThe hotel is very family friendly and everything is aimed at the kids.  This does mean that children run around and cause chaos from time to time.  We unfortunately were allocated a room 8004 next to a family who were extremely noisy and liked to come back to the room at 11.30pm and spend a hour running around screaming before finally going to sleep.  Our kids go to bed much earlier and it meant we all got woken up by their noise.  Things to bear in mind are that those rooms with an interconnecting door will hear more noise from their neighbours.  Also rooms on the ground floor near the play areas mean that you hear a lot of noise throughout the day and night.  I decided to bring up the noise with the manager after day 2 as I couldn’t cope with it every night of our holiday.  The manager couldn’t not do enough to apologise and arranged for us to move rooms that day. We were moved to building 3 and a room on the 1st floor at the end of the building and what a difference! This building is one of the furthest away from the main building and so generally much quieter.  The room had no interconnecting door. Only difference with this room was it had a large walk in shower rather than a bath so not all rooms are exactly the same.  Depending on your family needs I would defiantly request with the hotel a room on a high floor, non interconnecting and furthest away from the main building for a quieter experience.   The manager a few days later followed up with us to check we were happy with the room and we got a fruit platter delivered to the room.  I was super impressed with this level of service for a 4 star hotel.\nOne of the big perks with this hotel are the park passes.  You get free access throughout your stay to Legoland, Legoland water park and mitiongate theme park.  Our kids are aged 7 & 9 and all parks were perfect for them.  The rides at Legoland were probably a bit babyish but they still had a great day and enjoyed all the Lego building. Motiongate was the standout favourite and rides were all fantastic.  To be able to ride all the big rides you need to be 1.3m and they are strict on the height so if they aren’t tall enough they won’t be able to go on.  During our stay all parks were pretty quiet and we never waited any longer than 10mins for a ride and most times walked straight on.  We will never want to go to Alton towers at home again!\nAll in all this was a great holiday and we got a fantastic deal which was cheaper for a week than going HB to Tenerife.  The cost of the park tickets you would pay alone makes it a great deal.  Bear in mind this isn’t in Dubai and us a good 30min taxi to get to the malls or souks.  We have been to Dubai before so didn’t need to visit but if you do want to do Dubai then maybe this hotel might be too far out for you.  Also if looking to book, check flights into Abu Dhabi too as it’s approx the same distance from Abu Dhabi as it is from Dubai airport.",
