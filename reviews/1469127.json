      "text": "Very good quality and relaxing independent hotel in the best part of the island sheltered from prevailing winds and with direct access to the beach from the amazing lagoon pool.  The quality of accommodation, food and service are very high and you can see that the staff care about the guest experience.  This hotel benefits from a sister hotel Apollo Beach next door that is included in all inclusive package of the Blue hotel and adds another option for eating with fresh baked pizza and lovely Al fresco dining.  Any negative reviews on here are probably just some disgruntled and overly critical people who had a bad experience or would find anything to complain about but in general this is one of the best all inclusive resorts I have had the pleasure of staying and would come again.  Highly recommended and would return as I know is dependable.",

      "text": "My family and me had the pleasure of visiting this great hotel during the summer of 2023.\nDespite our initial hiccup – a booking mishap on our end, reserving a garden view room instead of the seaside view that typically includes complimentary airport transportation – the hotel staff showed remarkable responsiveness and understanding. To our surprise, they graciously provided free transfer from airport anyway, demonstrating an amazing dedication to ensuring their guests' satisfaction. This thoughtful gesture significantly increased our overall comfort from the very start. Upon arrival, we were greeted with an unexpected bonus: our rooms were upgraded to ones featuring private garden pool, adding an extra layer of luxury to our stay.\nWhile the accommodations were slightly below the anticipated standard for a 5-star establishment, they still offered a cozy retreat. The minor discrepancy in quality was easily overshadowed by the positive aspects of our upgraded rooms.\nThe all-inclusive package ensured a vast array of food options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even our picky son found plenty of choices for each meal, which was a pleasant surprise. The à la carte dinner and complimentary drinks from the pool bar added a touch of luxury, and the option to use the pizza stand at the sister hotel next door was a convenient and tasty bonus.\nThe hotel's environment offers a well-balanced blend of relaxation and convenience. With a main pool and a separate one for children, as well as its own part of the beach, we could easily choose where to unwind without the need for extensive travel.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the variety of entertainment options, including concerts and different musical performances. These added another layer of enjoyment to the warm evenings, complementing the already great atmosphere created by the hotel's surroundings.\nSpecial mention must be made of the outstanding and friendly staff. Daily small talk and the extra attention given to the kids further enriched our stay. The overall experience at this 5-star all-inclusive hotel was exceptional, largely thanks to the staff's commitment to guest satisfaction and the numerous positive surprises throughout our stay.\nWe are greatly looking forward to spending time there during the summer 2024 again.",
