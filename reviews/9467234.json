We reserved two guest rooms, both of which were well-appointed, clean, and spacious, exuding a sense of historical charm. The accommodations were equipped with all the necessary amenities to ensure a comfortable stay. Notably, for a three-star hotel, the facilities and services provided were exceptional.\n\nThe breakfast offered a delectable array of options, particularly the cheese selection, which was truly impressive.\n\nThe staff members were exceptionally accommodating and courteous.",

I had an early tour and requested early breakfast which was promised but in the morning the rude man said no bread nothing go without breakfast. The room with city view is literally like sleeping on a street, drunk people shouting till 4 AM, cars bikes honking and what not! The TV not working, hairdryer not working, when complained staff dismissed everything I said! The only positive is the location but I would rather pay a bit more and never stay here. Don't waste your time or money on this hotel at all. Worst hotel I have ever stayed.",

      "text": "This was our 'posh' hotel for our trip and it was worth it.  It's located near the ancient wall and the streets are narrow, curvy, and sometimes steep.  If you go there in a taxi, get off at the entrance to the Luna Garden and walk in a short way --- otherwise taxi can't get to hotel. We had room 324 with high ceilings, plenty of space and 6 gigantic heavy windows.  Omer came up to open and secure the windows which date from the origins of the building and, as Omer said, \"can break your hand\".  The breakfast buffet was excellent. You can eat inside or in the large courtyard.  On the main street just outside the city walls you can take the 'antique tram' directly to the Archeology Museum at the end of the line.  By walking a few blocks, you can get the modern tram directly to the airport.  Certainly if we go to Antalya again (which I would very much like), we would take the tram to the hotel from the airport.  Our favorite discovery was the free Ethnographic Museum.  We really appreciated the small carpets in the rooms.  ",

The rooms are beautifully decorated, spacious, and amazing for the price. The little pool is a plus too! \nWhat’s lacking from a perfect experience however is the staff, some of whom were quite cold. The cleaning staff though were very sweet and friendly! \n\nAlso note that the proximity to attractions also comes with a very busy street that’s loud late into the night. As an old building, the walls are also very thin so we were awakened by other guests laughing at 4am. \nOverall still a great experience, but definitely bring some earplugs!",
