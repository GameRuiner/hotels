      "text": "I have been in Egypt many times but this was the worsest visit. I know the standards of this price of hotels and \nthis one is not worth of it.  The room was very old and not very clean. When u walk thru the hotel \"shopping area\" then all the windows are covered by old bed sheets and full on dust. Food is not very good as well. Amphoras theater show was in russian language. When we checked in, then reception guy said that there is free bus to Naama Bay every evening at 8pm but you have to book it advace..witch is ok, but when we wanted to book to next day then he said to us thast not avalible.  Water slides were open only 10-12 and 15-17. Only positive thing was good weather.. I would not recomend this hotel.",

      "text": "Amphoras Aqua is a smaller and compact hotel that I really liked. Although the beach is about 500 m away on foot, there is an alternative for lazy sunbathers in the comfortable pool area. I think there is also bus to the beach, but it was strange to travel such a short distance by bus. I was also satisfied with the area of the hotel, it was clean and had enough green plants to please my eye. The location of my room was excellent, and the view from the room did not open to the neighbors, but thank you very much for the room with a beautiful view - I could see a bit of the sea! 🤗 Talking about the food ... I didn't find anything extraordinary, but at the same time there was always something to eat. Although I think that if food is very important and someone is looking for a food experience, Amphoras Aqua is not the best choice. With its beach, this hotel is great for coral and snorkeling lovers, and it has also an easy taxi ride to both Naama Bay and the Old Market for evening activities. I will definitely visit this hotel again ... if I can get the room with the same view! 😁",
