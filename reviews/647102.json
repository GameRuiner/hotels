      "text": "Aldau beach hotel is incredible good hotel resort. Everything is so clean and well thought through. Gastronomie is overall in very high level. Tang Beach restaurant and great service from Sara Ibrahim enrich the wonderful experience. You get nice drinks from reception bar or at the pool bar. \n\nI would like to also mention the Boulevard front of the hotel and the beautiful stores on it. You find there nice jeweleries, parfumes, nature product from Narjes, high quality cotton products from Cottonil. Oh yeah there are super cool bags and shoes visa-a-visa from Eqypt air duty free close to Carrefour.\n\nBig thumbs up from Switzerland.",

      "text": "We had a fantastic trip. The food, service and hotel was incredible. We really enjoyed the buffet and there is a large variety of restaurants also available. The beach is beautiful and both the beach and pool have good options for shade or sun. The kids club was good, we stayed with our son because of his age, and really enjoyed the different activities on offer and kids disco in the evening. \n\nThe only thing we would say the hotel could improve with is having their own hairdressers/ beauty salon. The company (Raa spa)  the hotel partners with unfortunately was the only negative of our trip after watching some people charged 300 euros more than us for the same treatment and a terrible treatment. The spa was not clean, treatment rooms were not private, the same towels were used for the facial as another person and nail tools were not sterilised between people. When I shared feedback after them asking me for a review I was told I was correct and guided to the door. I would advise anyone staying to steer clear of this place and head into Hurghada for a better deal and service. This was the only negative during our stay and while I do appreciate it’s another company that just advertises by the restaurant of the hotel, we trusted them having a desk within the hotel would mean a certain level of service. We did also share this feedback with the guest relations team and they said they would follow up, I hope they did after we left.",

Everyone is there to please you from the bartender at the beach to restaurant staff till the reception.\nThe hotel is very good and i will point out points:\nVery positive: customer service -looks like there is a lot of training and people is always with a smile in their faces, extreme cleaning from the rooms to surrounds(gardens, swimming-pools, beach), entertainment in the evening and active activities during the day, snacks and drinks in midle morning and in the afternoon, even freezing wet towels at lunch time to refresh youself before lunch. There is a special salted water heated swimming pool.\nPositive but could be better: in the buffet at the main restaurant i would aprecciate having more choice of veal meat, as a matter a fact it was a little repetitive.\nBeach is very clean and organized, but the sea level is most of the time down so is like a swimming-pool for kids.\nI would definetely return to this hotel focused in the satisfaction of the customer.",
