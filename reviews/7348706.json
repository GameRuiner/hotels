      "text": "This was a last minute reservation, and turned out to be a great choice for our needs. The hotel is located in a rypical neighborhood away from tourist hustle and bustle, very family oriented, kids going to school, people walking their dogs , near shops, restaurants, cafés, bakeries.  where mostly locals would shop. All walkkng distans from hotel. Great Italian restaurant less than 5 minute walk Pizzeria Trattoria la Briciola, old school decor,but check schedule they close noon and open for dinner. Walking distance to Plaça de Sants Metro station (L1 and L5 lines) which can take you to different points of intrests, maybe 10, 30 or more minutes to the different points of intrest. \n\nLoved the hotel, rooms simple budget , but rooms were very modern and very clean , quiet and secure.  The staff at front desk were great, I wish I could remember one particular young maxn , who was very helpful pointing out local/good restaurants. Hotel in lobby area has a small eating area with tables and chairs, water. Also a vending machine in lobby. No toom service, however as I mentioned around the area xplenty of choices of food choices, some good and some not so good, hit and miss, part of the adventure.  I definitely would recomend this hotel.",

Lots of cafes in the street, and a laundromat. The guys at the reception desk are super helpful, friendly, and they speak English. Only con- there is no second lock on the door, only the deadbolt that opens via key card. I highly recommend this hotel.",

It is locatated a three minute walk from the Placa de Sants Metro station (L1 and L5 lines) Placa de Catalunya is a 10 minutes away;  and the D20 bus service which can take you down to the beach area.\n\nThe hotel is eco-friendly with a no frills approach. We had a double room. The bed was comfortable and the heating/air conditioning was efficient. The bathroom was well-appointed. Our window faced an internal courtyard so we had no view but it was very quiet - no bad thing in a bustling city. The room had a safe.\n\nWe never tried the breakfast, There are vending machines for hot and cold drinks and snacks.\n\nStaff on the reception desk were friendly and helpful.",
