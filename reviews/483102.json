We had a family suite which looked over the street (good windows kept the noise out.) The room was a good size and the cleaners kept it immaculate. Breakfast was wonderful, local and high quality produce with amazing freshly baked croissants brought to your table. The hotel has an eco friendly ethos and the style and decor was beautiful. All the staff were so friendly and helpful, we really enjoyed our city break and would highly recommend.",

Lots of nice bars and restaurants as well and the staff throughout our stay made us very welcome from reception to breakfast and bar staff and overall  fab stay (pity about the weather) as I’m sure we would have spent more time on the roof terrace but didn’t due to heavy rain.  The Limoncello spritz cocktails were delicious!",
