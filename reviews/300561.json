      "text": "Check in/out-\nWe hired a private transfer and it was approx 40 mins from Bodrum Airport to the hotel. \nCheck in at 1400 and check out 1200. \n\nRooms-\nThis hotel is set over 3 levels.  Reception is at street level along with some rooms but restaurant, pool and beach are 2 levels lower.  There is a lift within the hotel. \nThere is 1 disabled room which has a wet room and a seat within the shower.  There are several ramps around the hotel and a disabled toilet.  One ramp in particular is very steep and is difficult to push someone up and down. \nThe access to the pool is via some big steps or a rather unstable plank of wood making the pool inaccessable for wheel chair users. \n\nLocation-\nThe hotel is directly on the beach front and there is a prom you can walk along to from one end of the beach to the other.\nOut side the hotel there are many shop, restauarnts, clubs and a large Migros shopping centre. \nYou can catch a Dolmus (Bus) right outside the hotel into Bodrum bus station and costs arouns 40p per person each way.  There is no offical time table just wait and wave one down. \nThere is a taxi rank out side also. Use a yellow taxi as they are metered so no need to haggle a price. \nTuesday has a large market in Bodrum selling genuine fakes. \n\nBeach- \nThe beach is beautiful.  Its very shallow and hardly any waves at all.  Perfect for children.  There are water activities at an extra charge.\nPlenty of sun beds on the beach and we never had any issues getting one. \n\nFood/Drink-\nThe first few days the food was plentiful and tasty but this seemed to decline as our holiday continued.  Im not sure if this is due to the hotel closing soon.  None of the food has any labels indicating what it was making it at times hard to recognise. \nThe food is all on hot plates however the food was still cold the majority of time even directly after it opened.  We spoke to the owners who attempted to rectify the issues.\nThere is 1 bar in the hotel that serves the standard drinks you would expect. Beer, wine, gin, vodka and raki along with a few basic cocktails and the normal soft drinks.  Tea/coffee and juice are self service all day.  \n\nEntertainment-\nDuring our stay there was no entertainment during the day.  Music would have been nice on the beach.\nThere were a few dance shows on some evenings.\nPool, table tannis and darts are available free of charge. \n\nThis was a 3 star hotel and with what we paid it was as expected.  The beach is the main selling point and beautiful.",

      "text": "A bit about our stay at samie beach hotel , we stayed in the anex building,  this is just across the road a small one way street  and about 15 to 20 meters away , we did not find this a bad as some reviews said there was lighting on the steps and stairs , the room was clean and basic and as I have found in Turkey before the air con did work and yes there was only 2 English channels on the TV  but as I'd not gone there to watch TV that is definitely not a problem , the view from the balcony was opstructed by a palm tree and would definitely benefit from a trim , the room was cleaned daily , we did have a problem with the toilet a leak on the water feed this did take around 1day for them to fix but it was fixed . There was a few dogs and cats that roam the area but that's again normal for Turkey no dogs did come into the hotel itself just the beach areas , WiFi is a problem in the anex area as its away from the hotel WiFi range and we was cut off early , we went to reception and it was sorted a day or so later when they realised we needed it to sort our transportation back to the airport , the food was good for us as we like to try different things from the country we are in but this may not suit everyone,  the was a very diverse client√®le from German Dutch Polish Turkish Italian and probably more I'm missing , for me and my partner this is not a problem as we like to meat new people from anywhere. The drinks at the bar were ok really a bit ov a choice and they was not tight with the measurements and fairly quick with the service,  I always feat safe here and would take my 10-year-old daughter and not feal I had to watch her all the time , the beach is right on the door step and cleaned by the staff and when you are eating in the restaurant there is a fantastic veiw of this , some of the seats where looking a bit worse for where and new cushion covers would be recommended.  The pool area was hardly used so sunloungers was always available the beach can be a little harder to get a good spot but we managed it without having to put the towels out at dafty o'clock in the morning so that was ok On the very last day I had left my bag on the back of a chair with my money apox 60 pounds sterling and my passport phone and personal effects I left it there for over 4hrs it wasn't there when I got back but a staff member had handed it in and all was there I don't think they had even opened the bag , all in all it was a very good stay and is definitely a 3star hotel no more no less but that's what we payed for , I would go back again for me and my partner it was worth the money we payed which was under 1000pounds for the two of us for one week including all food drink  flights and transfers,  thank you samie hotel ",

      "text": "We have just returned from our third visit to the Sami this year ! As before, we had a fantastic holiday. We were skeptical at first when we were told our rooms were over in the annex area. But we were delighted to be shown to the most beautiful, little newly refurbished apartment across the road from reception. We had 2 balconies, both with a stunning sea view. The bathroom and bedroom was brand new and it was spotlessly clean. The hotel was almost full  this month so they‚Äôre was a great atmosphere, however I would recommend getting down to the beach/ pool early for the best spots and also attending the restaurant shortly after opening to get the best of the food. There was slightly less variety of food than previously in June but there was something for everyone and it was all fresh every meal time. The staff are fab and can‚Äôt do enough for you, they work so hard 24/7 to ensure everyone has the best experience. Thank you for a fantastic stay. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again !! ",

Room was alright but the basic AC and refrigerator didn‚Äôt work. The balcony was very shabby. Also, there was no telephone connection to call the main reception. We had to personally visit to make our complaints. \nNo wifi in this building and the staff did nothing about it. Just coddled us that it will be fixed soon (never happened during our stay) \nBeach: the beach is good and since its private with beach beds and all. It was the highlight of the entire trip. \nFood/bar: the beach bar is fully functional and good. They have full 3 meals buffets with quite a lot of variety. Loved their food. \nEntertainment: they had good and fun entertainment nights and it was overall a very fun event for families especially.",
