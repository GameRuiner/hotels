Three or four stars would be more appropriate.\nAdvantages: The location in the city center is good (although the hustle and bustle and music at Placa Reial can be disturbing), the hotel has an old-fashioned charm with nice albeit slightly worn suites.\nDisadvantages: The breakfast is hardly five-star. Guests are forced to choose from four small fixed menus, which means you can forget about loading up for the day. Freedom of choice should be a given at a five-star hotel. Some of the staff should take a course in service. The hotel’s Wi-Fi is a joke.",
