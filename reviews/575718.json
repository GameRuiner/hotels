      "text": "My husband booked this hotel for a half term winter break. Family of 4 ( children 19 and 12). \n\nTraveling to the resort in our private transfer we felt apprehensive leaving the city and heading through what seemed like a baron area past docklands etc. we shouldn't have worried though because although the resort was out of the city it was a vast resort with plenty for all and very secure. \n\nOur room was large and spacious with nice sea views. Plenty big enough for the 4 of us. \n\nStaff were friendly and attentive across the whole resort (3 hotels)\n\nAs part of the all inclusive package we could use the restaurant and facilities in each of the hotels. Plenty of options to choose from all the restaurants. We ate at the sports bar, Italian restaurant, captains bar, several of the buffet restaurants all of which had a great selection to choose from. \n\nOur only main criticism was that different bars had different drinks included/excluded  on the all inclusive menu. We was able to get a coke at one bar but another we would have to pay additional which seemed somewhat confusing. \n\nWe enjoyed the kayaking and peddle boats that were included in our package. \n\nWe only spent 2 full days in resort as we had booked excursions into the city and a desert safari otherwise we would have tried a lot more of what the resort had on offer. \n\nI would highly recommend for families who want to visit Dubai.

It‚Äôs an outstanding family resort. \n\nWe normally stay at the Atlantis or Jumeriah Beach Hotel but we wanted to try something different this year and give all inclusive a go as food and drinks are expensive in Dubai. \n\nWe booked a Two Bedroom Residence Suite, which included butler services and lots of wonderful perks. We didn‚Äôt really know what to expect as we couldn‚Äôt find much information online in advance. We were totally blown away‚Ä¶ I agree with a previous review about the hotel unselling themselves. David, Marilyn, Mohammed and the Butler/Signature Pool team were incredible. We felt like royalty for the duration of our stay. \n\nWe ate at Smoking Gun, White Orchid, Tapiera and Sette. Wonderful food and service - thank you Darause and Aakash.  Tamr for lunch was great too‚Ä¶ great staff again! And to Levi and his lovely Mum at the water activities! \n\nSee you all again next year.",
