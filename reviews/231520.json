      "text": "This is where I truly deviate from the TripAdvisor norm:\n\nThe hotel was one of the worst I've ever stayed at.\n\nOn a good note, the room was nice.  Clean.  Pleasant.  All went downhill from there the three nights I stayed.\n\nThere's no room temperature control.  The room was too hot.  Front desk said to open a window. \n\nBreakfast was basic.  Nothing to write home about.  But hey it was free.\n\nHousekeeping inconsistent my entire stay.  I had to insist on cleaning each day.\n\nFront desk the most incompetent.  Pleasant but unable to carry out anything.  I even video recorded them in action (a first for me, ever, and I hope the last) just to show their lack of hotel skills.\n\nAn email to manager Pau Torreblanca yielded nothing but defensive responses.  No acknowledgement of failure to manage staff better.\n\nThis hotel is the equivalent of Super 8 in the States.  I would suggest other hotels in the Estacio Sants area.",

Had we realised how close to the Sants Station the Hotel is we may have taken the train .\nPleasant hotel, not much of interest nearby so we took the hop on hop off tourist bus from Sants Station  . \nBreakfast offered a good selection of hot and cold food. We didnâ€™t try the restaurant, preferring to dine in the city. \nRooms are clean, but small. Our room had just a bed and small cupboard with no hanging space long enough for dresses.there were no surfaces to put anything and no space to even lay our suitcases flat. For this reason I would not recommend for anything more than a brief stay.",

It was hot weather in September.  \nComfy bed and nice bathroom . Lots of toiletries in bathroom, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion, toothbrushes etc. \nGood shower over bath. Tea/coffee tray.\nBreakfast good choice and all the food gets topped up even towards the end of service. \nWe like being near Sants Station, easy to use the train and metro and buy a ticket for 10 rides for 11 euros, a bargain.

From the front desk to housekeeping to maintenance; they were very helpful (calling taxis, having our room ready early, responding to a non-working telephone in our room) etc. The room was clean and comfortable. Minor negative: one day, we returned to find we had not received housekeeping (no, we had not left the \"do not disturb\" sign on our door). Housekeeping responded within five minutes to put our room in order. If you're a fan of espresso, you will LOVE the coffeemaker in the room!  Same promptness with maintenance: our phone was not working, they dispatched someone right away to fix it. The in-room bathroom amenities are very nice. The buffet breakfast is excellent although we did not partake every day as it is not included in your stay. The location of the hotel is OK if you do not mind a lot of walking or taking a taxi to your destination(s). Overall, a great stay, due mostly to the excellent staff.",
