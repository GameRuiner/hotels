Breakfast was great and, at the end of our stay, the staff helped us print boarding passes, store luggage, and book a taxi. \n\nThere are lots of cats at the property - something to note - but you'll soon see that they are everywhere in Bodrum, so the hotel is no exception. \n\nBeautiful view from our room across the pool and the sea, with the mountains in the background. Definitely recommend!!",

The rooms are very clean, the personal is very friendly, the breakfast is delicious. This year we went both during New Year's week and this weekend. There were very kind notes and small accessories special for New Year's Eve. During our visit this week, a fruit plate was left in the room. Spending time around the pool is very enjoyable. We would also like to thank Mr. Deniz for the delicious cake which they prepared for our friend's birthday. I strongly recomment El Vino in Bodrum.",
