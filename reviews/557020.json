      "text": "Beautiful hotel with so much for the children. Lots of lovely pools with lifeguards on duty constantly. Different size and depths depending on what you want.\n\nThe room was lovely and a great size for our family of 4. Lots of food options including an Al a carte you could book one evening. \n\nThe pool size giros was amazing. The kids club are all DBS/ Police checked although it took a call to Switzerland to find this out. No one on site could tell me.\n\nVery helpful staff. If you saw something broken or out of place it was fixed almost immediately.\n\nAl pools heated, fully included mini bar restocked daily. Includes pool towels and safe.\n\nGreat hotel. Long airport transfer though, maybe 1 hour 40.",

Went kayaking and daily volleyball. \n\nRooms really spacious and ideal for our family of 5. Had a ground floor apartment near pools and could not fault. \n\nResort was coming to a close of winter season so entertainment was reducing throughout the week and restaurants were closing or reducing service but wasn’t an issue to us at all as we liked the variety offered still \n\nFab holiday all round",
