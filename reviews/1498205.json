      "text": "From my experience I believe this hotel has acted unscrupulously and I would be very wary of booking accommodation here through booking.com.\nIt was my daughters 30th Birthday so I booked three rooms in this hotel in November  2023 through booking.com for a break on 4th April 2024. The agreement was to pay the hotel on arrival and with the ability to cancel up until 1st  April. A week before we were due to arrive I had an email to say that they had tried to validate my credit card and it was declined. I checked the credit card details on booking.com which were correct and emailed the hotel asking them to contact me so that I could sort out the payment before I arrived. The next day my booking was cancelled due to an invalid card. My credit card company confirmed that my card was valid, had ample funds available and that the hotel had NOT tried to take any money. I phoned the hotel to sort out my booking but overnight (within 8 hours) my rooms had been booked so they had no availability. I went back onto booking.com urgently needing new accommodation only to find the rooms advertised back on the site at ¬£1554.00 MORE. So  they resold my rooms for more money leaving me and my family looking for alternative accommodation during the Easter Break- a very unprofessional way to deal with your customers I feel. Also, because I was to pay the hotel directly Booking.com said they were unable to help.",
