      "text": "We stayed at the hotel for 1 month, I think that is enough time to be able to observe and analyze what is going on around you and be able to give an objective feedback.\nI will start by saying that our check in was not so wonderful, however once we started to see all the facilities that this hotel has we were surprised, and even being a 3 star hotel it offers many more things that some others do not, so I will give price-quality a 10, however I think they can still improve a lot and become a very recognized chain in the middle east. \nHere are my pros and cons: \nPros: \n-price is excellent for long stays not only this one but any other ROVE that has monthly stays.\n-gym open 24 hrs. super equipped and clean \n-Playground area with several options for children and teenagers . \n-super cool decor and with taps to refill free water bottles \n-mini super inside the hotel wow and pharmacy machine\n-transportation to jbr marina or Battuta mall included\n-walking distance to parks.\nCons:\n-guest service is very poor, very few managers come by to ask how our stay has been, maybe the only ones who cared were the ones in the restaurant area. \n-zero friendliness from front desk employees, we almost never received a smile or anything extra beyond meeting our requests. \n\n-Room service is not room service, one day we dialed the number to daily restaurant and no answer, so as the digital menu says we tried with dialing \"0\" I think they responded in reception in a lousy way saying why not dial the number of the restaurant that was not there, super rude, so seeing all the movement in the area there is no room service department as such but the same guys in the restaurant area are the ones who attend, anyways we experienced several bad experiences ordering food...\n-Lack of staff makes the service very slow.\n-I had to ask the housekeeper to clean the shower area since it had been three weeks of my stay and not a single day had been cleaned.\n-I think that the constant rotation of cleaning staff makes the service inconsistent since in the whole month maybe 4 or 5 different people were doing the cleaning, I know it is rotation and by operation they do it that way but maybe when they are monthly stays they could modify that a little bit.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, however these are just suggestions because like you my husband and I have known the hotel industry for more than 10 years, we will definitely come back and maybe it will be in another ROVE that we meet, thanks to the people who made our stay a plus! \nTrixie, Ninh, William, Leo manager, Olek restaurant manager from Daily\nVirek thank you for your dedication in cleaning the room, very good attention to detail and Kishor rai from housekeeping thank you!",

It's awesome that you got to explore all the cool amenities we offer, especially the 24-hour gym and the playground area ‚Äì sounds like fun for everyone, young and old!\n\nWe totally hear you on the areas where we can do better. It's disappointing to learn that your check-in experience wasn't as smooth as it could have been, and we're sorry to hear about the lack of friendliness. That's definitely not the vibe we want to give off!\n\nYour suggestions about improving Rover service and room cleanliness are invaluable, and we're already brainstorming ways to step up our game. Your insights as seasoned travellers mean the world to us.\n\nWill be sure to pass along your shout-outs to Trixie, Ninh, William, Leo, Olek, Vivek, and Kishor ‚Äì they'll be over the moon to hear they made your stay extra special!\n\nWe can't wait to welcome you back for another ROVE adventure.

      "text": "Great offer ever- during Ramadan period. Staying for 36 hours are really enjoyable and fun, especially if you‚Äôre spending this moment with your loveones. Thanks Mr. Maneesh (room service), for providing our request during our stay. We got the connecting rooms as we‚Äôre family of 4 (adults). Rooms were spacious, neat and tidy. Great initiative for the glass bottled water, supporting sustainability environment. Breakfast buffet was good as there‚Äôs plenty of options. However, I think, the team didn‚Äôt expect the bulk of pay-in guests as refills of foods took time. The Ramadan promo doesn‚Äôt include breakfast; hence, we paid extra for the buffet. The hotel is close to Riverland park, in which Legoland is located. Lastly, thanks to Mr. Atif (reception), for the smooth checkout transaction. Overall experience is excellent and looking forward for more. Cheers!",
