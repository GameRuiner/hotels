      "text": "Not sure how this place received 4 stars, but here is my review:\n1. They do not supply washcloths and seem to have no idea what I was asking for when I requested washcloths be delivered to my room from the front desk and cleaning staff.\n2. I paid for a room upgrade that I did not get until my second night, that issue they completely blamed on the travel agency, I honestly do not know who was to blame.\n3. The room was freezing every night, even after I requested the air be turned off, and there was no heat in the rooms to balance out the freezing.\n4. There was a leak in the ceiling in the bathroom of the upgraded room.\n5. The bathroom was not clean the entire time I was there. The soap scum on the shower fixtures that was NEVER cleaned is my proof of that and none of the trash bags I filled with empty food containers were ever removed during my entire stay. If I didn't sit the bags outside my room door, which I find a tacky practice, they would just remain stacking up near the trash can in the room\n6. The refrigerator in the room does not get cold enough to keep food in it. When I asked they said the refrigerator is only for beverages, but that was not true because the refrigerator did not get cold enough to keep ANYTHING cold. There was no way to turn up the temp in the refrigerator.\n7. The is noticeable water damage all around the baseboards and ceiling of the rooms and hall. Makes me wonder about mold in the walls.\n8. I got hair dye on a towel, and they charged me 50 American dollars for ONE towel... that is ridiculous. Not saying I should have paid nothing, but $50 is outrageous and highly inflated.\n9. This is a 2.5 to 3-star hotel at best, but it is absolutely NOT 4-star.",
