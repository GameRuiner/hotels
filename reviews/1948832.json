      "text": "I spent 3 nights in this hostel in a double private room. The room and the beds were comfortable, the shower perfectly in function with hot water. No bins in the room and no possibility to open the window because in the morning there are people in the opposte side. The breakfast was delicious, gluten free option as well. The position in fantastic: close to the Diagonal metro station and 5 minutes walk from la Pedrera and Casa Battlo. I strongly recommend this hostel for its ratio quality/price.",

      "text": "Headline: I stayed for a week in two different rooms. I'd stay here again but with lowered expectations and clearer room preference.\n\nPros:\n-Great location on the edge of the Gracia neighborhood. <5 min walk to grocery store  and several restaurants. Walkable (~25-30 min) to city center, Sagrada Familia, Park Guell. ~10 min walk to Casa Battlo and train stop directly from the airport. Across street from Diagonal metro.\n-Quirky older building that has been modernized while retaining interesting features like the original floors, elevator, etc.\n-Full, good quality breakfast buffet included in room rate. Hot and cold options. Breakfast staff were friendly.\n-Reasonably priced (though pricing varied wildly...some days the full apartment was half as expensive as a double room, so look out for that).\n-Very comfortable beds. I switched rooms Monday during my 7-night stay, and both the single and double were of similar quality.\n-Street-side rooms have french doors and balconies (superior twin, room 220), great for fresh air and views. This room also had a full sized shower.\n-Lovely garden area\n-Coin operated washer and dryer\n-Luggage storage\n-Dinner in restaurant was good\n\nCons:\n-It's noisy. Lots of school groups, teams, friend cohorts as expected because of the dorm-style rooms. Doors slamming, running, etc. well after midnight. Weekends wer much worse than during the week. Noise was especially bad when in an interior room (414) that overlooked this weird internal alley (for lack of a better term) where the noise just reverberated and teens were yelling to each other, dropping things into the alley, etc.\n-The interior double room is extremely small, and the bathroom is even smaller. Barely enough room to navigate as a solo traveler. Would be very tight for two people.\n-The common areas aren't as advertised. (Seems they had a very good website designer and photographer.) Everything was just a bit more beat up in real life. The No Mas Te room is in the basement, which is a bit dark/creepy and hard to find down a separate elevator. De Tranquis is in the back of the restaurant and not accessible when the restaurant is closed. Biblioteca was unavailable, as it was used for group breakfast 6 of 7 days I was there.\n-The staff at check in and in the restaurant weren't very friendly.",

Really can’t beat the location in one of the most exclusive areas of Barcelona apparently. Rooms could do with more storage and brighter lighting, but I chatted with reception and apparently they’re doing a big refurb sometime in future to upgrade the rooms. Look forward to returning one day. Shout out to Adam for showing us around!",

The lighting in rooms was not good.\n\nAs a hostel we expected a lively atmosphere but after 11pm the commercial area was closed… \n\nThere was good storage at rooms with drawers that could be locked if you have your own locker. The bathroom was big. The room was never cleaned and trash not taken out. However we got new towels everyday which was good.",
