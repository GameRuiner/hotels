      "text": "Frequent visitor to Barcelona conference and this time at the Palau Congressos. Would have given this a four star if it weren’t for the stuffy rooms. Apparently they turned off the central aircon in March and so they recommend visitors to open the windows if they don’t want some fresh air. The room temp rose up to 29C at night when I tried to turn on the thermostat on the wall. When I opened the double windows the traffic noises outside made it harder to fall asleep. Wish they could at least put an electric fan inside the rooms. Otherwise the staff is friendly, rooms are spacious and clean, breakfast has a fair variety and of course the Metro is just right outside.",
