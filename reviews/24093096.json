Especially Taufeq was very nice. \nFor now on we will always book this hotel. \nRigga Road is like 10 mins walking, Goldsouq also and you can go with the boat to the other side for a very good coffee (Al Seef). \nThank you for this nice experiance Carlton Hotel!  \nAnd don't forget to book a room on Creek side otherwise you will look into a street and parkingðŸ˜…",

The breakfast  was good with outstansing location and view. The hotel is close to metro so that was an added advantage. Overall the experience was excellent. ",

      "text": "Strange start as a couple were being charged for a stain on a towel. Quite a fuss being made about this in reception. We were pleased to be given an upgrade to a suite (think that is all that is available) but the first thing we did was check the towels!!  Staff were very helpful and attentive. Room was lovely with a great view of the creek. The area is not great and we felt a single woman might feel ill at ease walking around here. The hotel is near the gold and spice souks and the metro which we found very easy to use. We ate in the restaurant once for dinner - the buffet one was closed and in the hotel area we could not find any decent eateries. We were amazed that there was only one type of beer on offer from a list of about 6 or more. The waiter did not understand our questions about the menu and had to get the manager. Main course was delicious. Decided to have a dessert - only one was available out of the list. Bit of a poor show for a 4 star hotel. But breakfast was the biggest disappointment. So little choice. The egg station chef would not cook poached eggs - took too long and he had no vinegar!! Only filter coffee available and that was pretty weak. There was no fresh bread on one morning and that morning the pastries and rolls were stale. One day there was no orange juice. Room was quiet. ",

We dined at your Lebanese restaurant, swam in your pool and enjoyed the view of Dubai Creek during our stay. Beni understood it was our first time in Dubai and looked after us meticulously. She was such a blessing! Also, when we checked out, Zahur helped us ordering our 2nd ever Uber ride and stayed with us until our luggage were in the vehicle. We felt like royalty! We recommend this location as it perfect if you want to visit Bur Dubai, Deira and learn all about the formation of Dubai.",
