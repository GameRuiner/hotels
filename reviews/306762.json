      "text": "Just returned from a weeks stay with my husband and 2 teenage sons. This hotel is faultless. Room was amazing and clean with a great view. Great location near train stop. You are one stop away from the Burj/Dubai Mall.  Pool staff can’t do enough to help you! Life guards are constantly ensuring everyone is safe, safety really is the priority with children in the pool. Reassuring to see! Staff up there find you somewhere to sit, get you towels etc.  Breakfast was busy but tasty! Room service lady was brilliant and went the extra mile every morning! Free Shuttle bus to the mall and beach was a great added touch! Very handy! All in all the staff make this hotel! Incredible!\nThank you for a fantastic holiday. We can’t wait to come back to the Towers Rotana!",

      "text": "Excellent city hotel in the heart of Dubai.\nThe location is superb - 3 minutes to the metro station, about 25 minutes walk to Burj Khalifa, 15 minutes by taxi to La Mer beach.\n\nI had a club room on the 22nd floor with a gorgeous view, the room is clean and spacious, has everything you need including a capsule coffee machine.\n\nThere is a free shuttle to La Mer beach 4 times a day, you get a beach bag and towel. The hotel has a pool, it is on the 6th floor overlooking the Dubai high-rises. \n\nThe hotel has several restaurants, with different types of food, buffet and order a la carte. European and Asian cuisine, all very tasty and fresh. HB+ meals include wine and beer, you can choose lunch or dinner.\n\nOn the first floor is a traditional English pub with live music, highly recommended.\n\nI would like to mention the very friendly and always ready to help hotel staff, especially the reception staff: Shokhista, Prashant and Daryl, all speak excellent English and Shokhista knows Russian.  \n\nIt's hard to pick on anything, everything is to a very high standard, maybe we should add usb or type-c sockets to the room.\nI definitely recommend the hotel - perfect combination of price/quality!",

The property is very well and the room are comfortable (except that we booked for 4 people and they only had rooms with 2 beds). \nBreakfast buffet is very good and it worth it. THe bar at the lobby is really nice if you are staying with kids and want to have some \"solo\" time without leaving the hotel.\nThe staff is really helpful and very nice! ",
