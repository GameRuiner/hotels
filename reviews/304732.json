      "text": "We have visited Turkey several times, and this was our second visit to antalya.  We love the historical features of this country and decided to visit both Aspendos and Perge once more. Both were wonderful, and we also visited Sise as well.\nWe are not fans of massive \"all inclusive \" type hotels as the local economy doesn't benefit from our monies.  we wanted a small hotel and Dogan was the only one we found from jet2. The hotel has a great location and the staff were other guests pointed out very helpful. Our room was poor. Located next to the pool and has almost no daylight.  The shower cubicle was badly fitted hence the the floor floods when the shower is in use. TheTV was faulty, and the housekeeping was also poor. Our room wasn't serviced the first day, on the second day we didn't have any bath towels. On the third day, the room was only serviced around 5.45pm after I complained. \nThis could be a great hotel, but as usual,  it was small details which let's it down. \nKaleici Old Town is a great place, and we visited many quality restaurants for meals and purchased many great value items.",

      "text": "We had a brilliant week here at the beginning of March.  The location is ideal.  It’s a 2 minute walk to Mermerli beach and the harbour.  It’s a 45 minute scenic walk to Konyaalti beach.  There are lots of restaurants, bars and shops on the doorstep and the Old Town is beautiful.  It was a little noisy at night but we did not mind.  We did half board and the food was lovely with a good variety.  The staff are extremely attentive and we felt really well looked after.  Ercan in particular was amazing at looking after all the guests and was very welcoming.  It was our first visit to Antalya and we feel this is a great base.  We would definitely return.",

Although very close to some noisy bars we did not hear any noise during our stay in February. The grounds and the hotel are kept very well and clean. The pool was not open but it was being cleaned and prepared ready for the new season. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Very easy to walk to the tram station, where we got the tram to Antalya Otogar for our journey back home. ",
