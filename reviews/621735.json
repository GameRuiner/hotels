      "text": "Chose Hotel Blauet because it was far cheaper than other options and was close to the airport. Eddy on reception was brilliant! warm and informative, nothing too much hassle. Went out of his way to explain the diversion on Metro and other advise. I work in a four star hotel in the UK and he made me feel comparatively miserable and unapproachable :) . All other staff also fantastic, printed out boarding pass without issue. Metro within walking distance of hotel with hand luggage although wouldn't fancy it with big hold luggage. Room spotlessly clean, got a good nights sleep and good free internet. Hotel well and truly exceeded expectations. Read a few reviews commenting on the expensive cost of taxi fares from hotel... Do yourself a favour and download the cabify app to your phone that is used across Spain. No worries about getting ripped off, cheap as chips. I will be returning to hotel.\n\nDisliked · Shower holder wasn't fit for purpose, so had to hold shower head while showering. Wasn't a problem though... Also didn't like the timer ticking down on the hotel website when trying to making a direct booking. Felt like a cheap pressure tactic and unnecessary. It actually dissuaded me from booking direct. Clutching at straws for dislikes though had a brilliant stay.",

      "text": "We stayed at the Barcelona Airport Hotel a week ago and the restaurant there was terrible and expensive. So thus time we switched to this small hotel in a nearby neighborhood. It is basic yet adequate as an airport hotel for one night stay although there is no complimentary airport transfer. The water heater is the storage type so the second person should wait a while before taking shower. There is also no hair dryer.\n\nThere are good restaurants around offering something good for dinner before flying out.",

      "text": "This is the archetypal basic-yet-clean hotel that I feel is deserving of a high rating because it is inexpensive (I apparently paid significantly less than some other reviewers, by making a non-refundable reservation through an on-line travel company). So, yes, the room is small and cramped, there isn’t a hair-drier, nor a wicker basket brimming with bathing accessories, and the shower runs into a half-bath. Nevertheless, the facilities are entirely adequate for the lone traveler in need of an overnight stopover between flights. I found the WiFi to be reliable, and the A/C was efficient. My bed creaked a little whenever I turned over, but was comfortable enough. Breakfast is extra: coffee, a couple of cereal options, some sticky buns, and slices of cheese and ham to insert between sliced bread (supermarket white). But at €3.50, there’s no cause for complaint. The staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful and spoke good English. \n\nThe hotel is only about a 10 min taxi ride from the airport, but after paying minimum-fares, plus  various supplements (for luggage, access to BCN, and for reserving a taxi by phone for the return trip - all of these charges are entirely legal), the price of my stay doubled.",

      "text": "This is a business and airport servicing hotel. The room was VERY small but it did have a window. There was a small single bed that kept pushing away from the wall when you would sit up with pillows behind you since there is no headboard and it is on wheels. The bathroom is tiny too with a half size bath, but the shower was excellent. Not much floor space and a small desk area. I was on the 2nd floor in the back building which was fairly quiet except for when guests were leaving in the morning and when the cleaning staff was preparing the rooms for the next guests. There was a nice big window that opened to a back street and provided good light. The wifi was sketchy at times. Sometimes there and sometimes not. I think the router was being reset a couple of times when I couldn't log on. Internet speed was average and varied. A few restaurants, a mini mart, and some bus stops nearby. One to the airport which was nice. Not very walkable to Barcelona center although it is really not that far if you like to walk. They offer a basic breakfast with coffee which compared to some is decent enough, but mostly the usual toast with butter and jam, packaged baked goods, and cereal. Unfortunately not very nutritious but 3.50 Euros. The staff spoke some English which I found rare in Catalonia. They were considerate but not over friendly. Barcelona is an expensive city to stay in but I feel Hotel Blauet is overpriced for what it offers. One thing that bothered me the most was that I asked the front desk if they could print out my boarding pass which every hotel I have ever been to has done as a courtesy, no charge. After printing 2 pages I was charged 1 Euro! Half a Euro a page. I politely told him that I have traveled the world and even small inexpensive hotels never have requested payment. He just pointed to a sign behind him on the wall which was unreadable from where I was standing. When I checked out I said there was no need to print me out an invoice as he had done for some business men before me, and since he didn't have to use paper or ink or the time to do so he could pay me the 1 Euro back I gave him to print out my boarding pass! Businesses that nickel and dime people like this should reevaluate their customer services and consider fair business practices as a courtesy. Especially since I paid more than my room was worth. But it is all based on money, and supply and demand and these are exactly the places I will not patronize as well as the countries they represent. When businesses care more about their bottom line and profit then customer service they should reevaluate their management.",
