I wasn't thrilled with the location which is not ideal for tourists -- we didn't feel safe to go wander outside looking for somewhere to eat dinner as we did in other places we stayed in Turkey. It's deep downtown in the large city of Izmir -- worked fine for one night but would not be my choice for returning to the area. ",
