      "text": "If I could give this hotel 10 stars I would! Loved every minute from arrival to departure. We stayed 4 nights in a sea view room. Everything was spotless and comfortable. We had a balcony overlooking Bodrum Bay. A main road is also visible but didn't take from our enjoyment of this beautiful place. Staff are excellent with a superb level of customer service. We had room service every night ( service charge for this added to bill ) and the food was great. Breakfast was included and was served upstairs overlooking the pool and the sea view.  Fresh fruit and breads and cooked orders as required. There was loads of choice and everything was top quality. The hotel accommodated us with a late checkout at no extra cost and allowed us to check out at 5pm instead of 12pm which was greatly appreciated. If there was a small criticism it was the pillows could have been more comfortable but overall this hotel is more than just a place to stay... its an experience!",
