      "text": "We arrived on the 18th March 2024 around 9-30 am, check in was 2pm but we were very lucky our room was ready for us  Floor 30, High Floor Apartment. We were expecting a City view but we got a lot more than that. The apartment had 3 balconys Palm View City View and we could see JBR beach, Big Wheel and the Atlantis Hotel. Bedroom view 7 star hotel Burj Al Arab Jumeirah AMAZING. There is nothing you can do about the balcony but i wish it was glass so you could see the views when you sit down as it is a wall and obstructs the view.\n\nThere is a lot of construction work in the area so be warned we had construction views and at the side of us construction which looks like a new hotel is going to be built at the side of the Arjaan this will probably stop the views to the side of the hotel which will be a shame but as I dont know what it s going to be it could be a year before it s finished. The noise on the 1st night was quite unbearable as someone who lives in the middle of no where with complete silence I really didnt think I would be able to live with it because it went on until after 3am it was very loud the following morning as well with the construction at the side was a different noise irritating loud knocking noise. I did say it to my daughter I don t think I will manage with the noise. She was delighted she said it sounded like the city and loved it and after 3 days it was just a normal sound but i dont think it was as noisy on the 3rd day onwards \n\nObviously we were delighted with the room views and the apartment was very clean and huge for the 2 of us staying, easily big enough for 4 people. The apartment had a washing machine, dishwasher, hob, fridge freezer, plates, cutlery, cups and glasses. \n\nThe bathroom was very large with a huge shower, great lighting and WC. There was also a seperate closet room with WC and sink. Extensive wardobes and drawers for all your clothes and shoes. The bedroom has a  Tv and Im not sure the size of the bed because I have a king size bed and it was a lot bigger. \nMy small complaint about the apartment was trying to figure out how to turn off all the lights in the apartment to go to sleep. It is a task every evening and I couldnt turn off the wardrobe lights. I think this system needs an instruction manual. I could have removed the key card but then I wouldnt have been able to access the small light at the side of the bed or being able to charge phones and electronics, I literally had to turn everything on and then off in every room in the apartment, I am sure this is not the correct way. \n\nWe were very busy during our stay, we had a lot of things booked and we didnt really spend anytime at the hotel to see any part of it, we did eat in the restaurant one day and my daughter said the best pasta dish she ever had and I had a requested (no dairy) tuna salad from the little cafe near the reception which I found refreshing and a big portion it was lovely, so I think if you have the full or half board the food is excellent standard.\n\nI did a lot of research for hotels in all areas of Dubai including the Palm and I definitely think I choose the right hotel for location, ease to get places and taxi use. We found all areas very easy to get to within 10 minutes and then the mall areas around 20 minutes and futher again Global Village 25 to 30 minutes. Taxi s are cheap, after visiting Bulgaria a few months where taxi s were very expensive. Dubai Taxis cost about 3 euro to 12 euro.Download the Careem ap for taxis grocery and food deliveries. If you dont want to use taxi s the over ground is very close we just didnt have enough time and with the taxi s being cheap we found it an easier mode of transport but you can save money on the over/under ground train / tram we just didnt work them out. \n\nThis hotel is in Media City and we will go again and I would choose not to be on the Palm I would definately stay in Media City again. The views are fantastic and you can see everything and you are not trying to get taxis off the palm everyday. If you are staying at the Palm in a resort and dont intend to go anywhere else that might suit you, but we like to go everywhere and see other parts of Dubai. I do know not all the rooms are renovated and it was my intention to see the other rooms available because we intend to go back in the next few months with more people but I think I would prefer the renovated rooms again but i think you can only have 2 or 3 people in them I will need to enquire. The door men were very pleasant always saying hello and goodbye and having a chat. All in all I would definately stay here again for location, views and renovated high floor rooms.",

      "text": "I travel to Dubai because of my studies. The main reason I stayed in Arjaan was because the location of the course was in the same hotel. And now I know why my business school chose that hotel. It has an excellent location, an amazing and beautiful hotel, with a gym (that I used) and a pool. But the best part was the excellent quality of service, from the check-in until the check-out. The only two things that were not that nice were that my room was kind of old (but the rest of the hotel was not), even with one of the closets smelling old (which, sadly, I forgot to report because I just didn't use it). The other thing was that one night, some alarm noise woke me up. Of course, that is not the hotel's fault. In any case, the fantastic view, the cleanliness, the superb service make it all up.",
