They didn’t speak much English but it didn’t matter a smile goes a long way and we made an effort to learn a bit of Turkish. It was clean and tidy and the staff were lovely.  The breakfast was sufficient and made a nice change to what we used to Emre and the reception Staff were very helpful and attentive. The location was good and handy for local shops and Cafes and we would thoroughly recommend it. ",

      "text": "We booked a queen-size bedroom. The only asset I can retain is that we have a living room in addition to the bedroom, leaving us with a good amount of space.\n\nHowever, the room was not well-kept. The lights did not work properly, the only chair in the room was broken and reeked. The small couch had a huge white stain on it. \n\nThe bathroom smelled like a sewer which worsend overtime.\n\nThere was no cleaning or changing the towels during the five nights we stayed there.\n\nAnother huge drawback was that barely any staff members spoke English. And the one who did didn't understand our request for a second blanket, as they provided us with a small double blanket which did not suffice. \n\nAfter experiencing the meager breakfast buffet, we asked to get a refund of the breakfast upgrade for the remaining nights. They did not refund us the money.\n\nOverall, this place is mouch more run-down than the pictures would suggest. As the living costs in Turkey are fare lower than in Europe, this hotel's rate is overpriced for the poor accomodation you get.",
