      "text": "I was very concerned when I booked this hotel as the reviews were really bad but thought of taking a chance and to my surprise, it was a very comfortable stay. Though the hotel looks old, the room was very clean with all amenities provided viz, kettle, teabags, glasses, tissue box, toilet rolls, bathroom slippers, towels, soap, body wash, shampoo etc. Room service was good, the location was super convenient, very friendly staff, and even got a FOC late checkout. Avoid the lower floors as they can be quite disturbing as the noise coming from the Indian dance bar (only if it bothers you) on the ground floor is really loud, and they are open till 3 a.m.  Overall experience was good, and great value for money.
