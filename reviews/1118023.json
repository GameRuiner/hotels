      "text": "The hotel is huge, the Sentido and Reef Oasis are next to each other and Sentido guests can use both. The rooms are a little dated but the Service is excellent. \n\nOn arrival we had a problem with the patio door in our room and Mohamed Zohairy had us moved to a better room very quickly and gave us a personal tour of the resort by golf buggy.\n\nMedhat Amr from the blue bar worked hard to learn our coffee and wine preferences and brought us drinks and snacks to our pool loungers.\n\nAt Mos buffet we had the best service from Medhat, Mahmoud, his deputy and the team,. They greeted us at every meal and talked me through the food options for me as I am Gluten and Dairy free. They were absolutely exceptional and even went as far as to make me specific bread and deserts to give me more options! Asif was our server and learned all our preferences and anticipated our needs brilliantly.\n\nWe booked into two Al a carte restaurants and the team briefed the staff at these and went ahead and made sure our needs were catered for which was fantastic.\n\nOur housekeeping team in 1258 were excellent, going the extra mile to clean well but also to leave us flower and towel art!\n\nAll of the staff were amazing, they seemed genuinely keen to ensure we had a great time. We were blown away by their kindness and will be back with our families for a longer trip!\n\nThanks again team!",

Fabulous holiday here in October 2023, we rebooked.\nI almost do not want to share my views, so I can keep this hotel and staff to myself.\nThe Sentidio resort and staff are amazing. We were made to feel like the most important people daily. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were Eager  to a bilge. \nThe food was good and a lot of choice.  Gabriel, Hassan and Mina were fantastic, and very funny. We had daily banter with them, which we clearly enjoyed and hoped it made their day too. I bow down to their professionalism.\nThe al a cart restaurants were all great and came out well fed. The Italian again the staff were brilliant, Arafat, and the manager, who I now canâ€™t recall his name. excellent service also in the grill and Indian restaurant.\n\nWhat can I say about the lads Medhat and Khalil in the blue bar. They were amazing keeping us topped up with drinks. Medhat had the most infectious laugh. \n\nFinally Mahmoud Nasief, you are a real diamond, a lovely kind and  helpful man and manager. It is no wonder your staff are excellent with you as a role model.\n\nWe look forward to coming back and I am sorry if I have missed anyone out.",
