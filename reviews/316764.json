      "text": "Wow! I am 100% reiterating all the earlier reviews \nWe arrived late at night and the driver asked us to walk down a little street, turn right at the top, the hotel will be opposite on the left. I did wonder where I was going!\nWell there it was - a small, pretty quaint hotel surrounded by flowers ðŸŒ¸ \nThe interior is beautifully decorated with a lovely little courtyard where you can sit and relax or eat breakfast there. \nLeading to the courtyard is a well stocked bright bar with comfy seats both at the bar and surrounding it. To top it all there is Kevin. What a lovely guy and what a pleasure to be in his company. We had some good laughs with him and nothing, absolutely nothing is a problem for him. His personality is super cool!\nAll the staff are super attentive and always laughing. Hotel reception is manned by a team of three ladies who are very efficient. \nBreakfast (varied and plentiful) is served by very helpful smiling staff. Thank you everyone and especially the staff who clean the rooms. Such a lovely touch to walk back in later in the day and the bed is made up, towels changed and bins emptied. The pool outside has enough sun beds  for everyone and a great bar offering a range of food tea, coffee and alcohol. Do try the Greek Burger!! Maria thank you so much for your service, attention and fun times. Big thank you for my strong coffee with fresh milk!ðŸ˜‰\nThere are some lovely restaurants along the main road ( be careful it is a busy fast through road to Rhodes town and motorbikes donâ€™t respect pedestrians). Napoli at the end of the road is excellent and so popular. Happy, happy staff.  Also El Greco with fine Greek food.\nThe pebbly beach is across the busy road(ðŸ«£) where you access to sun beds, we were never charged.\nTo sum up our holiday - Nathalie is absolutely beautiful and you would be mad to miss out! Wow ðŸ¤© \n\nJean and Glenn",

Breakfast was good with plenty of choice.\n\nA special mention to Kevin the barman, Paola on night reception, Maria doing breakfast and pool bar and all the day time staff on reception,they all couldn't do enough for you.\n\nThe only downside in my opinion is the shower as the floor got absolutely soaking wet.\n\nPool area was lovely and clean.  Good value for money.",

      "text": "Stayed here in October and the hotel was quite full.Its set off the main road in a residential area so when you get your transfer they drop you off at the main road because mini buses cant get up the road and you just have to walk to it .Very Quaint Greek Hotel,its very clean and the staff are very friendly and cant do enough for you,plenty of choice at breakfast and the pool bar serves great food.Rooms are basic but cleaned on a daily basis.My friend and I had a family economy room as it was cheaper than two double rooms.Its basically two rooms with an interconnecting door and a shared toilet with a balcony for each room overlooking the pool.the shower wasn't the best as the whole bathroom got soaked as its quite small.Its in a good location to explore Rhodes and if you dont like the hustle and bustle of being in the city center but like to go in and come away.It has frequent bus services in and out of the center.Buy your tickets from the supermarket its cheaper than paying the bus driver,Numerous restaurants and shops in and around the hotel and a big supermarket just across the road. The Hotel will organise tours for you we did Lindos in the evening and Symi Island which were great value for money.Rhodes old town is a nice place to wander around with plenty of restaurants and shops it does get quite busy when the criuse ships are in,but generally you can find a nice quiet spot.",

      "text": "The 3 star rating doesn't really do it justice. Above all the friendliness of the staff really made it feel like home. Most of the guests at this time of year (October) were retired couples like ourselves and there was a nice relaxed vibe. There is an outside area covered by an arbor with vegetation where you can eat breakfast, or drink a beer in the evening.  The pool is clean and adequate. There were plenty of places to eat and drink about 10 minutes walk away on the main beach road but we found Rhodes Town more interesting (E2.30 each way on bus) ",
