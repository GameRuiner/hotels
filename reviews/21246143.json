Super helpful and polite!‚Ä¶Sanam thank you for the extra bottle water because I am breastfeeding so considerate. The kids enjoyed the stay!. We had an amazing time here and can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thank you to the staff at the front desk. My husband tried the jacuzzi a bit warm not hot but it was nice. The only complaint I have is that we are a family of asthma so there is too much air freshener in the hallways. But once you close your door and open your balcony it‚Äôs much better. I hope that you can reduce the amount of air freshener or go with someone herbal like eucalyptus oil or peppermint oil. Otherwise amazing stay!!!!",
