      "text": "I stayed at plaza hotel for three days. It was better than expected. Room was clean and comfy. Lack of balcony was an unpleasant deficiency for me. Breakfast was average. There could be more options about foods but it was not a big issue. You can order food from outside. There is no restriction about it. Currently Hotel is under process of refurbishment and i stayed in an updated room. I can say that it is a good place to choose for a few days of vacation. ",

      "text": "We booked this hotel for our wedding night as it was close to our wedding reception. We drove around to look for it the day before & ended up driving past it 3 times before realising it was the right place. It still has 'Plaza Hotel' written outside & from the outside, it did not look a very welcoming place. We decided as it was only for 1 night, we would stay there anyway. We arrived Saturday afternoon with our belongings & was very surprised to find the interior decor very tasteful & well planned. The hotel was a lot bigger on the inside that it looks from the outside & our room was lovely. A very decent size with very modern decor & comfy furnishing. I have to say, the shower was amazing!!! Breakfast was typical turkish self serve, with everything you would expect to find. All in all a very pleasant stay & would definately recommend. The only reason I give it 4 star is due to outside appearance.",
