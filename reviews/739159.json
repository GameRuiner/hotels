      "text": "Things we were disappointed with were the evensing entertainment which did not meet the standard of other hotels we have stayed at. We were a part of a group of 11 and there was not one day where 1or more of us were not ill with vomitting or diarrhoea. We took every precaution but to no avail.Towell attendant at the heated family pool was rude to my wife. The Indian restaurant was a shambles both with service and food quality. There did not seem to be enough loungers to parasols on the beach although the attendant worked really hard to try to find us enough.On the positive side the buffet had a good selection and the other a la cartes were good.esoecially the Asian, Mexican and Mongolian. The grounds were beautiful and the hotel itself well maintained. The environmental awareness was good but fresh drinking water fountains would cut plastic bottle waste hugely.Raising wareness of food wastage by showing figures is a great idea.The majority of the staff were very polite,friendly and helpful. Mention to Mohammed in main buffet",

A few little changes every year which are a positive outcome. \n\nMy only negative comment is that on the Beach people have been allowed to reserve beds (EARLY AS 6.00am) with items other than a towel e.g bucket,  hat, plastic bag,  bottle of water, snorkel, scarf. in my observation these people DO NOT TURN UP til after 10.00am.  When genuine people are looking for a bed. I do honestly think Management should put something into practice. \n\nRestaurants you cannot go wrong with either food or service.  No paper menu anymore, make sure you have your phone for QR CODE to access menu.\n\n We stayed in Block 28, had excellent cleaning from Mansour. \n\nOnly bug bare was key card not working 8 times out of 14 had to go to Reception, apparently faulty wiring in the electronic door.\n\nSee you next time Mamlouk.",
