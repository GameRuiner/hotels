      "text": "Staying at Esperia Bellevue Suites was an extraordinary experience. This small boutique hotel with only 13 suites is located directly at the beach. Our suite was spacious, modern, clean, equipped with everything you need and more (fridge, coffee maker, even a washing machine) and had a stunning view. We only used the small rooftop pool once - the weather allowed for bathing in the sea, which was even more attractive! \nBut what really made our stay special was the team. The hotel manager Katerina made sure all our needs were met and inquired in person several times whether everything was alright or anything could be done better. Theodorus greeted us in the morning and made sure the breakfast made our day (it's your choice whether you want to have breakfast served in your room or downstairs in the breakfast room - no buffet, you have the full choice from a menu and the team will try to meet all your wishes). Nikos welcomed us in the afternoons and made sure we got a reserved table in fabulous restaurants each night and always had good suggestions on where to go and what to see next. Room service was fabulous as well. Big thanks to the whole team!\nOne thing you shouldn't expect: getting to know other guests. The whole atmosphere is meant for privacy, it's quiet. Although we were here in January we don't think this will be very different in the more busy times of the year ",

For example, we had the choice of having breakfast delivered directly to our suite, or we could have eaten in the dining area. We opted for a breakfast in our room every morning, which was delivered by Dimitris, with a smile.\nWe also had our own kitchen facilities, if we desired to use them. The room service was twice a day. The suite was large, spacious, clean, and decorated in a contemporary manner. The bed was very comfortable, and we really appreciated having two bathrooms in the suite. The view of the Aegean Sea was heavenly!Staff were very accommodating to ALL of our needs. ",

Starting with a friendly email from the manager Katerina the hotel staff did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as it could be. The room was clean, lovely, cozy, and well equipped with a beautiful view of the beach. We particularly enjoyed the tasty breakfast which came with an expansive menu and the option to eat on the hotelâ€™s terrace or have breakfast brought to our room (both included). The bread basket was the best bread I had in Greece â€” so tasty! The staff was also super welcoming and helpful with recommendations of things to do, including encouraging us to go to the water park when we asked about it, which we thoroughly enjoyed. ",
