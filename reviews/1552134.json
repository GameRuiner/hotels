Rooms are large, comfortable and very clean, the grounds are beautiful, specialty restaurants delicious and easy to book, and buffet had a nice selection. Michelle from the beach bar and Botros from the heated pool bar were both standout staff. They made this trip even more memorable. \n\n1. The only cons were the guest that felt they were too entitled. Some were very rude with staff, left garbage everywhere for staff to clean up even though there were plenty of trash cans. Not following pool rules and very loud.\n\n2. After being on many cruises and visiting Caribbean resorts the entertainment wasn't the greatest and could use a bit of an update. Lots of dancing and lip singing. \n\n3. Even though the buffet opened for late night meal it would be nice to have a late night snack bar that serves things like pizza, burgers and hotdogs in the evenings for folks with late night munchies.",

Last year we decided to try the Rixos adults and wondered how we would be without the entertainment of our children.. Oh my goodness, we were in for a surprise. I now recommend this hotel to every age group I speak to 18+ to 80.\nAfter spending the day on the beautiful beach on the sick, padded loungers, we call at the beach club from 4 pm till 6, where it is \"rocking\" have a cocktail, then go back to shower in the luxury of a beautiful spacious room. \nIn the evening we passed quartets playing along the path's,  cello, saxophone violin, most beautiful- then on to one of the superb à la cart restaurants of our choice. Where the staff seem pleased to see us and welcome us like old friends yet with the respect that we expected. \nWe then sit at a bar while we digested, before heading on to the live music, and shows beachfront and bar. \nAlways ending  our evening in the lobby bar with a new favourite drink, baby Guinness. \nI'm happy to answer any questions. \nBut take it from me, what are you looking for, whatever age, group, or gender, you are. Rixos adults Egypt have it covered \n\n💥We are putting our money where are mouth is an returning \nApril 17, 2024 in   2 WEEKS TIME !!!  \nPS Rixos our room was 4008 we would like it again please x",
