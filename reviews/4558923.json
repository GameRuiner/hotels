      "text": "Firstly, the location of this hostel is excellently located just a block away from Diagonal Metro Station where three metro lines converge which made it really easy to travel with the metro.\n\nThe dorm that I stayed in was a mixed one and was quite cramped, but what the heck - you only sleep there. Every bed had a curtain that could be closed to get some personal space which was great, so once getting into bed it felt quite spacious.\n\nThe room had A/C and the bed had a small shelf with a bed lamp and an A/C-outlet.\n\nWhen I checked in the bed was already made which I believe is quite unusual at hostels and that made a good first impression.\n\nThe common areas consisted of a quite large room for meeting new friends an an even bigger outdoor terrace. There is also a common kitchen and a fridge that can be used.\n\nThis is probably the best cleaned hostel I've ever stayed at and the desk was manned 24/7 which is a great thing if you need help to order a taxi to the airport (I had an early flight so the Metro was not an option).\n\nEveryone at the desk speaks great English and were all very helpful.\n\n",
