      "text": "The hotel deserves an excellent rating due to the amazing location, superb cleaning staff who always have a wide smile,  brilliant chinese restaraunt onsite,  reception  staff are always very helpful/courteous upholding marriot  standards to the fullest with local emirati hospitality,  nothing is too much to ask.  I was extended early check in which was very kind, as i was recovering from a flu and need a room asap.   I wouldn't hesitate booking this hotel at all if you want the best experience in diera area at reasonable prices.    \n\nJust one small minor suggestion, access to communal microwave would be amazing to heat up food brought from our relatives or outside.  \n\n",

The view was amazing and the sun that came inside in the morning was perfect to wake us up. The breakfast was decent, it could be better. The dinner was amazing thought !!! Every person was polite happy and respectful. But actually the one I LOVED the most was NAVEED! He was so helpful, polite and respectful he helped us by calling us a taxi EVERY SINGLE DAY! We became close friends and he thought us many life lessons that were very touchingly! Lastly me, my family and my friend had so much fun in the playing room, especially the pool table! I would surely come again and suggest it to you!",
