I didn’t use the Asian restaurant but that looked equally as impressive. The rooms are big and spacious with a nice big bath (reaching soap a little awkward from the bath). The swimming pool area is part of a health club and is very pleasant with plenty of sunbeds and an attentive bar staff. Attractions best reached  by cheap taxi/Uber which works well. This hotel is highly recommended and has lovely staff throughout.",
