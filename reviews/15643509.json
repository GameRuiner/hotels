      "text": "I stayed here in February as I was having dental work nearby so didn‚Äôt choose this hotel myself. The amenities here are fabulous there‚Äôs a bar/bakery that‚Äôs open until 1am, hairdressers, spa, fully kitted gym, games room and really nice restaurant on site. The rooms are worn and need repairs the chair was broken and had cigarette burns in and the bed was super uncomfortable the light bulbs need to be changed also due to this I can‚Äôt rate higher then 3 stars. As students live here it‚Äôs very noisy in the evening and was difficult to sleep. My room wasn‚Äôt cleaned as I didn‚Äôt request it as didn‚Äôt know you had too so this isn‚Äôt the hotels fault. I recommend the deep tissue massage it was amazing and all hotel staff are lovely. There‚Äôs also a supermarket on site that sells all snacks and alcohol and cigarettes if that‚Äôs your thing and the prices are very cheap in Izmir.",

The shower was fantastic!!! \nPool was perfect for a quick mor ingredients swim before delicious  breakfast in the restaurant \n\nThe guys on reception were great and helped us book taxis and give us some great ideas and places to visit . \n\nThey even arranged for the taxi to Izmir airport to stop at Ataturk mask for photos !!! Which worked out great .\n\nBig thanks to Ege and Ali \n",

They also enjoyed the facilities for children and adult such as, table tennis, play station 4 , pool tables, and gym.  \nThe staffs were very nice and smiling at you.  Room services was performed by very kind and trust people.  There was a 24 hours security at the gate.  There was car parking for customers only.  There was a supermarket opened 24 hours.  The supermarket prices are similar to other supermarkets.  The metro station is very closed to the accommodation.  It was just 4 minutes walk from the accommodation.  I will stay in this place again for my next holiday in the future.  All room facilities were available, you can check the website. ",
