      "text": "Stayed there twice, end of January/beginning of February and end of February. They state 4 stars, but I confirm it is a low level 3 stars hotel. Management is Egyptian-Indian and the quality of the rooms and services is accordingly. As the Chinese saying goes, fish stinks from the head. The hotel caters mainly for lower middle class Indians. \nThe check-in at my 2nd stay was pure disaster. Arrived at 1pm. Oficial check-in time was 2pm. So the let me wait one hour. At 2pm they still weren’t able to check me in. They were overtaxed with groups of Indians. Had to leave in order to do my errands. Deposited my luggage and returned at 7pm at which time I still had to wait until the check-in procedure had been carried out completely. Definitely not a 4 stars hotel. \nRoom was basicly clean, however not spotless clean – filthy carpets and couches, hair threads  in the bathroom. Sink and bathtub were clogged. Remote control for the TV-set was missing. Poor reception of TV-channels. Lots of channels from the list on the bedside table were missing alltogether. The connection point between shower head and hose was leaky. Talked the snags with the reception staff point by point. They managed to fix them partially. After switching off the TV-set the screen showed a blue display which disappeared only after about 2 hours – hard to fall asleep under such circumstances. Didn’t have any breakfast, however had a stroll around the buffet: cheap products, smell was unbearable. \nHad a guest for short time on my room and they levied a visitor charge of 200 AED (55 USD) which in my opinion is sheer blatant greediness and reflects the criminogenic energy of the management. \nRest rooms in the lobby area are a disaster: clogged and dirty WCs, no soap, water supply let to desire, water taps defect. My suggestion is to use the toilets on the rooftop. \nStaff was courteous, however not all of them were well trained. Asked the concierge to arrange a restaurant reservation for me and he was simply incapable to tackle it. He had obviously difficulties with tipping Latin letters. Reception assisted with the task. \nOn the 5th floor there’s Tehran Club and a bar which are frequented by hordes of Iranian and Central Asian prostitutes, their pimps and clients. Acccordingly, there’s a brisk trade in the lobby and in the lifts during literally every night of the week.",
