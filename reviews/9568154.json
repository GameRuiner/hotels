      "text": "I was checked into this hotel after having to book something deep in the night (as the hotel I booked originally decided to cancel my reservation without any notice).\n\nThe front desk employees were absolutely welcoming and polite, the check-in process was smooth and I was shortly in my room.\n\nThe room was spacious, clean and had every amenity one could have wanted to have. There was a couple of complementary bottles of water, as well as tea/coffee making set. The bathroom was clean and fully stocked. All I cared was to get a good sleep and a bit of a breakfast before heading to the city. \n\nThe breakfast was good enough, albeit I would have imagined that a few more fresh fruit options could be beneficial. \n\nWiFi wasn't working that well, when I had to take a call early in the morning, I re-connected via my phone, as the internet dropped - and this is, perhaps, my only real point of improvement towards this hotel.",

      "text": "Comfortable and clean hotel with helpful and courteous staff. We prefer it  on our weekend trips mainly because we can just take the train from the airport and the station is just behind the hotel (3 min flat walk) and my daughterâ€™s friend live nearby. There arenâ€™t many grocery stores or other shops nearby, except that if you decide to walk 10-15 min thereâ€™s a good shopping mall with plenty of options. It is easily accessible by car. The breakfast is ok but wonâ€™t be included if you made your reservation through the hotelâ€™s own website, which is odd as that option is not offered at all. You can use other reservation sites to choose that option. Room service menu is limited and quality is ok. The lobby area is quiet and comfortable, offers bar and restaurant menu. We keep coming to this hotel and recommend it.",
