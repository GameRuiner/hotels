Shared bathrooms a bit cramped and could do with some freshening up. Our room was off the street, so a bit noisy. Doors close by pulling shut... sadly our neighbours thought this meant they had to slam them (including middle of the night). A normal door handle would be better if renovations are planned.",

So when you get to the place Google Maps takes you inspect the doors next to Subway and you'll find it.\n\nOther than that, location is great for central Barcelona.
