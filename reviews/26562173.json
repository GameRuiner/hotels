      "text": "We have had vocations here from 24th of February till 4th of March. The territory is rather big. Many swimming-pools, animation for kids are various and fun. There are 6 restaurans in this hotel, you can choose whatever you want. Most of all I liked different kinds of fish and prawns.The animation team was great, we had different activities in the morning with the modern music. I liked streching classes and yoga with Oleg and Roger. Also dancing classes(Zumba) was magnificant with Roger and Okaa. At night there were really intreresting enterrtaining shows for everybody. I would like to say that is the most comfortable hotel I have ever been. I can recomend it to everyone who prefer comfortable rest with good serves.",

      "text": "We spent a fabulous 10 days at Aquablu over the Holidays with my family. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the aquapark is just fantastic for all ages and you can vary your slides all day long. Even the lifeguards are nice and remember you. The shuttle or the nice little walk to the beach is also nice to have. The beach is also beautiful.\nFood is actually great with nice variety and how about the service!! I cannot remember the names of all the waiters, but they were all nice to us. Special thanks to Abdelrahman in the “La cave du roi” Buffet. Also, thanks to the staff at the Café. Really great coffee!!\n\nWe also spend a great time with the animations provided. Thanks to Oleysa, Didi and Taz, Okka, Sofia, Bakar and DJ Yankee who made our days go by so quickly with their smiles and great animation.\n\nThis is really a nice place to go on vacation, relax and enjoy your time!!",

Always happy and welcoming. The gentleman that cleaned our room, Ibrahim Maher, was absolutely fantastic. Daily he done little designs with the towels and petals and was so polite.  Just couldn't fault. As an all inclusive, the food was generally very good - lots of variety - and drinks were always on hand.  Everywhere was spotless. They won't even let you walk to the entrance if they can help it. The golf buggy comes past and makes you hop on! I would 100% return to this hotel. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "This is an amazing hotel… large, countless pools and a really good aqua park with a mix of thrill slides and many more options from toddlers to teenagers.\n\nFood is amazing…… with loads of chicken and beef options plus grilled and fried fish as regulars.\n\nThe best thing however is the staff… amazing service from room service to waiters to restaurant managers.\n\nShout out to Omar for very personal and friendly service in the restaurant and also a big Shout out to SHADY… the manager that got us a big plate of prawns simply cos we were not having any of the meat options available and were following pescatarian diet.\n\nI would say the only downfall of the hotel is that its not a beach hotel.. there is a beach at a sister hotel  and shuttle is available or you can 20-30mins walk but cross a dual carriageway and to be honest the beach is not even worth it… one of the worst beaches in sharm.\n\nAlso to be a real 5star and compete with the like of Rixos the hotel lacks Al a carte restaurants.\n\nI highly recommend this place as long as beach is not your main requirement.",
