      "text": "It took me awhile to write a review but here I am. First of all, this was my 7th time in Egypt and I don't have high expectations but this hotel was a breath of fresh air. Upon arrival I was met with a warmth and kindness, check in was smooth and the service was great. Staff was helpfull and polite, the hotel is very clean. The room had all necessities but the most important - air conditioner was EXCELLENT. Brand new, works like a bee, silent and easy to adjust. Other things in a room were more than satisfactory I had no issues whatsoever. \nThe food in a restaurant was tasty, they had a decent selection. I've tried both of a la carte options: they have a pizza and a burger. Both delicious, dare I say - best pizza in Sharm el Sheikh so by a very small margin pizza won a contest for me. I loved that they served drinks in glasses instead of those nasty tiny plastic cups that are so popular in Sharms hotels and the staff was truly lovely. \nThe beach is small but I never had issues trying to find a sunbed there. And here comes one big minus - there are no toilets in the beach and just a one shower so it was an inconvenience to climb up all the steps everytime I needed to go to the toilet. Other than that, I struggle to find something negative to say. I really truly enjoyed my holiday in this hotel. It is peaceful, clean, professional and lovely. \nI would be glad to come back again and again and I highly recommend this hotel (that is unless you go to Egypt for snorkelling). The reef in a beach is not up to my standards because it is small and mostly looks like a giant wall (it's deep but there are no coral gardens and not enough length to swim). However there is a big school of blue fishes just by the entrance to water and it looks spectacular. We opted to go snorkeling to other beaches in Sharm, went on a boat trip and etc. If snorkelling is not something you care deeply about I would choose this hotel ten times out of ten. My very best wishes to all the staff there and compliments to management team for their excellent job. 10 points goes to the gardener for beautifully maintaining all the plants in the territory and once again, thank you for an awesome holiday in your hotel.

      "text": "The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were clean, pretty and comfortable. Bring tips for the cleaning personal. We were able to eat and drink whenever we wanted to. The food and drinks there was mediocre but that is okay. Our stomachs got full anyways.  We didn't go out to see Sharm that much because the hotel had so many activities and the animation team there was absolutely amazing. Because of them we didn't wanna leave! There was shows every night, which was fun too. When we went clubbing it was very safe. The animation team made sure we went together and left together. It was so much fun at this hotel! When we're coming back we're going to this hotel. \nA little note: The staff at the bars and in restaurant likes to be flirty with the girls and that to me is a little unprofessional. They weren't uncomfortable but you got told that you are pretty many times a day. \nBut again shout to the animation team! Their energy was 100 each day and they did a great job at making us feel welcome! After two weeks we still feel the energy from these people!  Great hotel if you bring kids too! \n\nAll in all a nice experience!",
