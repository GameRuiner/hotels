      "text": "Location was good. Central, near attractions. It's a walking distance from Basmane Train station, Metro station and Izban station. \n\nWe booked a Triple Room.\nRoom design was uninspiring. There was a small balcony but half of the space was occupied with the air-conditioner unit and it wasn't clean  so we didn't use it.\nThe shower area is SMALL even for us smaller sized asian ladies. \nThe towels and bed linen were clean but looks abit worn out. No toiletries were provided btw.\nThere's bidet spray for my fellow bidet users.\n\nBreakfast was good. We enjoyed the spread.\n\nFemale receptionist is good in English and polite. Housekeeping staffs were polite. They were nearly done cleaning our room when we checked in but she did not make a fuss. ",
