      "text": "We had a nice stay at this hotel for 8 nights. Rooms are large and had nice view but shower in bathroom was not easy to get into as right door was not working properly. Sink is very low. Room kept spotlessly clean daily replenished water tea coffee milk.\n\nPool was nice but music very loud so?after one day we moved up to wave pool area as ypu could still hear music but not as loud. Pool shallow more for children than adults. Wave pool was good as actually felt deeper. \n\nFood was very much catering for Russians do lots and I mean lots! Of dishes in thick sauces all warm rather than hot with exception of the BBQ chicken they cooked outside most days which was really delicious. They did really try to change food when they received complaints from English people so credit to them. We always found something we could eat even though we ate repetitive things. \n\nThe bars vary in drinks. I liked the cocktail list they had and asked if they could make a long island ice tea and they did! It was lovely and every evening we went to the bar he would make me one without even asking and bring it over. My partner drank beer and he liked it.\n\nThe beach area is tiny for the number of people and disappointing but they did have a small bar and put out snack food at certain times. We only used it once as felt like sardines in a can as sunbeds very close together with little personal space. \n\nThe staff definitely make this hotel. They are kind courteous polite and professional and will do everything in their power to make your stay brilliant and enjoyable. We took single Dollars to give as tips which were appreciated by everyone. They really deserve the tips. \n\nI think if they improve the food and repaint and fix tiles around pool and wave pool we would come back to this hotel.",
