      "text": "Lovely hotel, staff couldn't have worked harder. Buffet very good, lots of choice and always changing. Food always hot, plates cleared quickly. A la carte restaurants not to our liking surprisingly. The italian restaurant had a set menu so no choice what to eat, others were similar. Pools were good, lots of choice and normally sunbeds available. Entertainment staff interacted and were very friendly without being over pushy. Lots of evening entertainment, and a sports bar on site. All very clean , room we had was for 3 and was plenty big enough. \nWould recommend, only downside is other annoying English tourists, but thats not the hotels fault!!",

      "text": "Stayed at Akti imperial as a package holiday all inclusive. I'm quite happy with the  hotel.  We had a room with balcony overlooking the sea which was amazing. Room was clean, tea and coffee making facilities. Mini bar refilled promptly every day. Towels a bit on a gray side, not 5 star standard. Staff generally very friendly. Special thanks to front of House guest services. Restaurant with many options. Variety of foods available, buffet refilled instantly with fresh foods. Staff should really be recognised for good work,  not easy in this massive 700 bedrooms hotel. Few pools with bars, private beach with easy access. Food and drink available all the time. \nUsed fish spa wich was amazing. Not used the spa facilities or indoor pool. Daughter pleased with hotel gym.  Local tax of 10 euro per room per day took us by a surprise, I imagine it is the rate around Rhodes. \nI would say solid 4star rather than 5 advertised by our travel agent but we had very pleasant experience.  Highly recommended.",

Our TV was in Romanian and ended up not working which we made reception aware of and they did not fix. The skirting boards are lifting and the floor was dirty and the towels were frayed and had stains on. Aircon doesn’t work and everytime we showered the drain lifts off. \n\nFACILITIES \nDefinitely not enough sunbeds. This was easter half term and it was extremely busy so i cannot imagine what it’s like in summer. The staff don’t seem to know anything. There was a bingo poster with little information so we went and asked multiple staff and they all said they don’t know. \n\nFOOD\nFood was quite good, lots of options however the waiters/waitresses are constantly hovering and the queues for food is a joke. On the plus side there is food 24/7 which is nice, and the crepes are really yummy. \n\nOverall we felt super unwelcomed and everyone is just a bit rude. A 3 star at most!",
