The hotel has a dance bar sort at the lobby level. Shady crowd! We stayed on the 7th floor in a suite where there was blaring music until 3 am from the rooftop disco I guess. Blaring loud Bollywood music I might add. The bathroom tiles looked like they never had been cleaned. The carpets were disgusting with stains. Perhaps that's why there is such dim lights in the room. Even the blankets looked unclean. Most unhelpful staff too. It is one most the disgusting places I booked. Terrible, please don't go there.",

      "text": "Our booking was for room only, so we cannot comment about the food. The Luxury suite was spacious. We were first given a room on the lower floors, but we asked for a higher floor and then were given on the 6th floor. Our room window had a street view which was open to the sky, so we were lucky. We did not use the pool. Our room was clean. First, it had a fusty smell, but then it went away. The bathtub was clean. The room service was prompt. The food at the hotel is very expensive, given that you got brilliant Indian options just outside the door in the vicinity. There are multiple clubs in the hotel. We asked for an early check-in but were denied citing high occupancy (which is understandable given that we went during peak season). We asked for half-hour extension for check-out and were given immediately. The location is central, walking distance to the Al Fahidi metro station, which is a great blessing. Overall - a brilliant stay. The reception staff just don't smile, for some reason. Other than that, no complaints at all!!",
