      "text": "Had been with the family on the 6th of April 2024 to Arabian Court during the holy month of Ramadan. The ambience and decor is superb. Their service was very courteous. Right from the variety of fruit juices or soft drinks and then the layout had a wide spread for Iftaar. Very well managed and organised. I have visited quite a few places in Dubai for Iftaar since 39 years and this really needs a mention. They do have a wide spread of Arabian desserts but if I may point out that the chef needs to be told that their Turkish Delight are too sweet ! Maybe a little too much of powdered sugar that they have been quoted with !!\nDr. Javed Rasheed",

      "text": "The Arabian court Ramadan experience was nothing but an absolute disappointment, characterized by poor quality of food and service. Untrained, lazy waiters who just gatered in a groups of 4-5 for a  chat and ignored guestes ,with limited English proficiency, unpleasant odors,totally unprofessional staff, including former shisha servers now working as waiters, no manager around to monitor whats going on ........all contributed to the dissatisfaction. This can't even be compared to a 3-star service in Dubai. Last night, the  group of 30 of us who attended were shocked by the remarkably low quality of service, food, and presentation this year.",

      "text": "We have been there for the third time and were very disappointed. The service has deteriorated dramatically. The room is outdated and smells of mold. When we wanted to change rooms, we were kept waiting for hours and then offered to pick up our suitcases for the other room at night (11pm). We were lied to and kept waiting several times by reception. The room cards didn't work every day. Restaurant reservations were simply not made, so we were left without a table. The room was also not cleaned properly. At first, the used body lotions from the guests before us were still in the bathroom. Then the room was forgotten to be cleaned once and there were no towels. There was a lack of communication within the team. I would have expected compensation for all the inconvenience. At least we were allowed to keep our hotel room until 2pm on the day of departure. That's a small consolation. We are very young guests and I had the feeling that we were not being respected. But for me, that's not 5-star service. We were also bothered by the extreme construction noise on the beach. Construction is going on around the hotel 24/7. It's best to take noise-cancelling headphones with you. The breakfast was worse than at Celebrities but still good. The complex is very beautiful and well-kept. The food options are excellent. Dinner at Celebrities was particularly special. The service here was also excellent, as it should be and that's what I would have expected all week.",
