Facilities are the best than any other family hotel in dubai within this price range. My favourite breakfast spot is Sands Beach Club where you feel welcome and looked after from the second you are entering. My coffee arrives within 2 minutes if not less. Thank you knun Ton and the team. I also recommend water Gymnastics with Artem who makes it so much fun that my kids can't wait till next time he is at the pool side. We look forward to our next visit to wonderful Centara. ",
