      "text": "Carlton Tower Hotel Dubai\n\nDubai\n\nWorst ever Hotel stay\n\n1) I check in and go straight to freshen up and to my surprise there's no outlet to fill the bath tub but a shower over the tub with water pressure so low that it could take hours to fill it up,  They refused to do anything about it.\n2) The only shower i could use was overhead in the tub, at one point the tub got so slippery I almost lost my balance.\n3) Door won't lock on its own if left to close, so I called the maintenance the guy who say I need to bang the door for it to lock. So anyone could have entered if I forgot close the door with a bang.\n4) Rooms were non smoking but the second floor lobby was filled with smell of second hand sheesha smoke, it was so bad just walking from lift to room would give you headache, when complained someone sprayed cheap room freshener, and it's the same the next day or even in next few hours.\n5) Worst location in Dubai, you'd find scammy massage card all across the street. Even my coworkers advised never stay in the area or hotel.\n6) Everyday for next 14 days, 14days when ever I came back to hotel in the evening the key card stopped working and had to go back to reception to have it fixed.\n7) they have swiming pool on second floor and a guest can be in the pool area unless they buy something from hotel room service menu, well if that was advertised somewhere I'd know better, for I had worst ever interaction with the hotel staff. Who was boderline hostile asking to place and order or leave. I am like dude I just sat down let me have 5mins to get my thoughts together after long day on meetings, not a chance. Insane. Same night inanswered the survey and mentioned this incident and every hotel staff wanted to know what happened but didn't offer any feedback on what they did on the complaint\n8) Finally the last night of my stay I had to ask hotel reception to break a 500 AED currency note and they gave me a fakes. Which got me detained by Dubai Police at Dubai airport when trying to buy something from the duty free store.\n\nI immediately emailed the hotel and all I ever heard back was we will investigate and get back to you and nothing since.\n\nI stayed there from Nov 29 2023 to Dec 12 2023\n\nDon't ever stay at the hotel and never exchange any currency for sure.\nThe claim to have currency scanner and still gave me fakes. So it was probably done on purpose by the man on the reception desk. \n\nTo conclude it was a horific stay ever",
