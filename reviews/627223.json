      "text": "The staff were lovely but the hotel did not on any way meet our requirements. On arrival we find that all inclusive does not mean that at all!! It did not include wine or beer on their limited list of alcohol!!! According to Love Holidays when we  asked to be moved we should have asked before we went what all inclusive meant to that hotel.  Never before or since has those 2 basic drinks not been in all inclusive.  \nThe food was very limited in choice and totally unedible We are not fussy eaters and love all food. Having been to Egypt 4xs before have had no problem with what had been offered.  \nThe room was not clean,  neither was the bedlinen.  Curtains were dirty around the edges.  \nTurned the hot water on in the morning the whole tap moved and brown scalding hot water errupted from the tap over me.  \nWe arrived just before dinner closed and we're not impressed but breakfast was even worse. Cheap meat and cheese with stale bread and bright orange made up juice greeted us. \nAs Love holidays would not move us we decided to pay ourselves and go to the hotel we boosted and enjoyed the year before.  What a difference, lovely food again,  clean rooms,  very friendly staff.  Thank goodness as it turned a disaster into a good holiday.",

      "text": "Booked holiday to Egypt through loveholidays in December. Was meant to be a very much needed holiday for my husband and I. Arrived late Monday night & was quickly shuffled into the restaurant along with the other new arrivals. Where do I start....food options were dreadful, the all-inclusive was a joke, no snacks, beer wine or even bottled water (you had to pay for these! EVERYTHING stopped at 10pm. Was like a badly run retirement village. No toilet paper or kettle in room. Our hotel room was dreadful. Absolutely filthy, run down & near derelict. Broken fixtures, mould, blood stains & cigarette burns on bedsheets. Heavily stained mattress & my poor husband was bitten very badly by bedbugs. The following morning (less than 12hrs later) I was looking to book flights back, as there was no holiday rep there. Hotel offered us another room which was just as bad & loveholidays didn't want to know when I contacted them. We couldn't afford the £900 plus to move to a different hotel. Unfortunately we couldn't get a flight back home until Wednesdays. So spent a total of 1 and a half, of our 10 day holiday. Even after providing loveholidays with all our photographic evidence, we are still battling for all our money back. There were 9 other couples who are all in the same dire position as us & loveholidays removed the above hotel from their website 2 days into our holiday, after all the complaints they received. Sham of a ccompany utter disgrace",

      "text": "First of all, ignore the moaners. If you book one of the cheapest 3* All Inc available don't expect a 5*hotel. What you will get is comfort, cleanliness, great pools and gardens and the nicest most helpful staff you'll ever meet. Worth every penny! Great pub-like bar with football on TV, and entertainment most evenings. A free bus will take you to a choice of 2 beaches which gives you a chance to visit the famous Farsha bar or snorkel off the beautiful coral reef further up the coast. Pay a few £ and you can use the lovely beach with a 10 minute walk down the road from the hotel. Taxis are cheap and plentiful if you want a trip to Old town or Soho. Haggle the price, and you'll get a bargain. As you are in Egypt hopefully you won't be surprised to get Egyptian food! Nuggets and chips or bacon sandwiches won't be happening! Enjoy Beautiful breads, salad, fresh veg, rice, soup chicken and fish, amazing burgers and koftes. Lovely omlettes and pancakes for breakfast and BBQ most evenings . Pool towels are available and the pool bar is open daily for tea coffee and cocktails. Bottled Beer is payable but very cheap in the hotel. We had a great time for 10 days, made great friends with the staff and would return tomorrow given the chance! ",
