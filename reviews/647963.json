Check-in took some time but please keep in mind that this hotel is full most of the times. Porter took my luggage to my room and was very polite. Room are big in sizes compared to other hotels but are old & have started to look tired. Renovation is a must. Next day breakfast was just normal & nothing fancy. Receptionist was bit rude while requesting to check-out. May be she was under pressure. Hotel is close to lots of eating joints just across the street.",
