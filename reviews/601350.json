      "text": "I checked out earlier than anticipated but had already paid for 4 nights a total of 1153.89 which was outrageous. I came in one day prior than my reservation and Fernando said my extra night would only be 88.00 euro. I agreed to it. I went to my room and there was mold on the ceiling the bathroom was dirty and when I mentioned it to Fernando he said he could refund my money and take my business elsewhere. I checked in at 2am with a family of small children. Where was I going to go and he knew I was in a bind so he was rude. I then the following day spoke to two front desk ladies which assured me that I could leave early without paying a penalty as I paid for flexible rate. My first night was 88 and second night was 270.00 which as is was ridiculous because I saw other people's quotes which were laying on the counter for anyone to see their private credit card information (courtesy of Carlos) at a much lower rate. Then after attempting to check out Carlos was rude but after an hour and 15 minutes of haggling me and trying to charge me for 3 nights which I was only there 2 tells me that my refund is only 400 then he says no 500 then after more arguing he says okay 700 is the best I can do. After further arguing we find my initial charge was incorrect and I had paid 100 euro more than I was supposed to. He then attempted to haggle me down more and say he had included that in the price. All said and done he refunds me 700 back. I leave upset but accept it. Come to receive an email later that night that someone made new reservations at this hotel and charged me again the full rate and cancelled my refund which they gave me hours earlier. No explanation or anything. This is fraudulent and the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel I was not present for the cancelation and recharge of the fees. I did not receive a call nor did I authorize a charge on my card. They fraudulently created new reservations and charged me without my permission or card present.",
