      "text": "Amazing apartments and as everyone says- super clean (make sure you leave a tip for the cleaner/s). The owners were very welcoming and helpful with buses, places to visit, etc. Savvos also set up satellite tv near pool so that I could watch my beloved Spurs.\nRooms were spacious and kitchen facilities adequate for self-catering- the fridge is decent size. Balcony has sun all day and we were on 3rd floor with absolutely stunning view of sunrise and mountains. The area is a little run down in parts and noisy but the pool and sun lounger were welcome in minimum 26 degree cloudless weather- brilliant. In fact on one day, I was glad for a little cloud, but that was only for a few hours, the rest was clear blue sky and I recommend coming in early October as most restaurants and places are still open. Rhodes is a super Greek Island.\nWe visited old town, filiremos monastrery, Ialyssos beach and many of the local restaurants and cafes. We ate lunch at the hotel once, it was nice and reasonable but there was limited choice. There are many returning guests and the atmosphere was very friendly as spoke to much more people than usual. Would definitely visit again- may be next year",

      "text": "Had a lovely weeks at these apartments. Everything is so clean - I think they changed the sheets every day except on the Sunday. No rush for sunbeds! I saw the pool being cleaned every day and the aircon is amazing ( we paid €50 for the week) We only spent one day by the pool, and had a Greek salad from the snack menu which was very nice. We didn’t have breakfast as we were self catering. There was a full size fridge in the room, along with a hob and oven but we didn’t cook anything - there are so many great places nearby to eat I can’t imagine many people would cook there! We arranged one excursion to Lindos through them and the bus picked us up just on the main road, a few minutes walk away. The hotel is set back from a very busy road but apart from the occasional noisy motor bike, it was quiet and we slept well at night. A word of warning, the road is very busy and whilst there is a pedestrian crossing, the drivers seem to drive through when the green man shows! Also the local drivers ignore the zebra type crossings! We caught a taxi into Rhodes town which was €15 each way - the bus stop is nearby but looked so crowded so we treated ourselves. Would recommend for a good value basic and very clean accommodation as a base to explore from",

      "text": "We stayed at these apartments last week. The whole place was spotlessly clean you could eat your dinner off of the floor. The Family who ran it were fantastic. The grandfather took us to his Daughter’s restaurant and picked us up even though we said we would get a taxi. We stayed self catering but had breakfast at the Hotel each day as it was really good and also we had what we wanted even if it wasn’t on the menu. One day when we went on an excursion at 8.00 in the morning they opened the bar at 7.00am instead of 8.00am and cooked us all breakfast which they weren’t obliged to do at all as we were self catering and had all the facilities in our apartment for cooking. Also as our taxis were picking us up on our departure day at 2.00pm Stavros shuffled the rooms around so we could keep them until then. The whole Family went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Other guests there had been going year after year and were regulars and I can see why. We definitely recommend this Hotel and thank you to Stavros, Christina and George ",
