The bed was very comfortable, our room had air conditioning which was bliss.\nThe staff were great very friendly and helpful, we ate in the hotel restaurant a couple of times the food was amazing and Mehmet & Adelina who work there are just lovely. I also used the spa for a Turkish bath & massage it was fabulous and I highly recommend Annie. We spoke with the manager to praise the hotel and the staff everything was great I can‚Äôt recommend it enough üòÅ",

He is courteous, professional, warm and welcoming!! What hospitality is all about. He made our holiday. He advised on places to eat and shared his knowledge on the local area. \n\nAdelina is a very pleasant young lady too. She served us politely and courteously too. \n\nWe are looking into a return visit next year. We hope these amazing staff are still here.",

      "text": "Where to start?\nFirst day, put in ground floor room. Stank of urine, told it was a drain issue. Room in need of a good clean. Decor dated and desperately needs refreshing. First use of hairdryer and all electrics kept going off. Took two hours to sort. Asked to move rooms and finally got moved after three days. Replacement room marginally better. Cleaners spend half their time smoking in stairwell. Room wasn‚Äôt cleaned for the rest of the week and had to ask for towels otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have had clean ones. Loud Turkish rap music from 10am till late at night. No pool rules as several groups were in the pool at 4.30am. Several parties being held in rooms. Bar food ok but drinks expensive. Breakfast poor and clearly catering for Turkish guests. Asked for Gluten free options and no one knew what we meant. Restaurant was more a glorified cafe.\nBeach area filthy and full of stray dogs. Walked to the Bodrum windmills to be greeted by litter, beer bottles, people sleeping rough, dog mess. Don‚Äôt go there as it‚Äôs awful. Admittedly this is not hotel‚Äôs problem but Gumbet is not a nice resort. Shops full of fake gear and owners continually trying to force you in to part with your money. Bodrum town and area is much better so would suggest people stay there.\nThe hotel is not there to cater for couples and families. Ok if you are Turkish and under 25 as the music will be more to your taste and clean rooms are probably not high on your priorities.\nWould not return here or this area ever again.\n\n",
