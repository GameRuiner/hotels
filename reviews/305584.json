      "text": "We visited this hotel for 5 nights in January and found it to be extremely clean and all staff were really welcoming and always willing to help. Rooms were modern and spacious. One thing that we observed was that the hotel is accessible for individuals with reduced mobility as the showers were walk in and there were lifts to all floors. \n\nThe hotel is situated approximately a 25 minute walk to the Sagrada Familia, a 15 minute walk to the Arc d’triomph, a 35/40 minute walk to Barceloneta and a 50 minute walk to Park Guell. If you prefer to not walk, the closest metro station is across from the arc d’triomph which will take you all around the city. \n\nThe only issue was with the air conditioning, it didn’t seem to blow out air cold enough to cool the room down. This wasn’t an issue as we visited in January, however, in the summer months this will be a problem. \n\nWe are unable to comment on the breakfast as we decided to visit local bakeries in the mornings.",

      "text": "The hotel is a ten min walk from Sagrada de Familia and L Arc de Triumph. However its  a cab ride from Las Ramblas and the beach.\nBarcelona is pretty well connected with Metros, Buses and Cabs so travelling in Barcelona is not a worry at all. You can stay at whatever area its not an issue.\nFor me this hotel was the costliest amongst all my hotels in Spain, I just thought it was not worth the price that they are asking. The breakfast was nice, however not exceptional.\nWhat I did not like about the breakfast entry was there is a barricade before you enter into the breakfast seating which as a guest I found not so welcoming.\nWhy would you put a barricade for a hotel guest. There is an attendant in all hotels to take your hotel room no's down when you enter. Then why do you have to go through this.\nAlso -on the first day I wanted hot water from the coffee machine -I did not know how to operate the machine. The person in the coat did explain to me but I switched off the machine by mistake again,.....His reaction.... he folded his hands and got irritated that I made the same mistake again. \nI thought that was not nice. You don't want such staff at the breakfast table.\nAlso when I was outside my hotel Room and went to communicate something to my sister 2 rooms away, since we were talking in the hallway ….not so loudly -a hotel guest ranted her frustration in Spanish showing me the DND sign.\nDon't know if the hotel rooms are sound proof or no.\nAlso I paid a city tax of Euros- 29 for a 2 day stay-which I thought was quite a bit after paying so much for the hotel room.\nThe positives the reception staff is very welcoming and so is the lady at the breakfast table. She was very courteous.\nThe rooms are decent and clean.\nTo sum it up this hotel is very pricey for the facilities and services they offer.\n\n",
