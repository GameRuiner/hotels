As part of our package we had access to the Signature Lounge which is amazing and the highlight of the stay. Always the same staff, same service and same attention to detail.. Vish by the pool, Kim at the pool bar, John and his team of butlers and ofcourse Islam who makes every stay memorable! We just wish we could have stayed longer!",

      "text": "The resort has outstanding facilities and indeed a must-try for families opting for fun and relaxing getaway. We enjoyed the beach and water activitites for the kids. Our room and hotel areas are very clean and well-maintained. Our stay could have been perfect if some staff could have been a bit pleasant to us. The reception staff who did our check-in process sounded very rude/ not pleasant when asked questions about outside food policy and late check-outs - which we understand. I was just asking questions, yet her answers were very sarcastic and not truly what you would expect to those who welcome guests in a hospitality setting. Furthermore, she has accused me of lying/not including kids in the reservation yet it was in mentioned in the original booking - her attention to details and personality needs some work. Despite this, the caddy drivers, housekeeping and concierge staff were really pleasant and wonderful. Overall, we had a good stay in the hotel but some staff needs some customer service/ personality training.",
