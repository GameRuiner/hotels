      "text": "This hotel is perfectly situated close to the sights and action of the gothic area of the city.  We also had a long morning walk to and from the port area and up to Montjuic Castle.  The beds were super uncomfortable and hard and the lift was small and slow but the hotel itself was clean and comfortable.  The rooftop jacuzzi and bar closed early which we weren’t aware of before heading up so that was disappointing.  On a sunny day though I expect it would be lovely with the view and seating around.  Free wifi was rather slow but still appreciated having that access.",

Location was brilliant two mins walk from metro.\nOn our arrival, we were greeted with a smile and offered a free Prosecco or soft drink.  There were also a supply of sweets and chocolates, tea and coffee to get your sugar fix available at reception. We were given the relevant information and were able to check in as our room was ready ( we arrived early). \n\nWe stayed in room 505, which was on the side of the hotel and was exceptionally quiet.  The room was very well equipped with all the usual including a free safe, fridge, hairdryer etc.. we had a modern coffee machine with ample coffee pods and also tea and biscuits. Two free bottles of water were also replaced daily which was greatly appreciated after a long day sightseeing.\nThe bathroom was of a very decent size with large shower, lighted mirror, magnifying mirror and copious bottles of “Rituals” toiletries. The fresh white towels were changed daily if required.\nThe bed was clean and comfortable and sheets were changed regularly. \nBreakfast was between 7.30-10.30 and was taken in the main deceptively spacious restaurant ( be aware this can get busy at certain times).  There was a large selection of both hot and cold high quality food.\nThe roof terrace was great, had brilliant views of the city and food and drink were readily available. There was also a small plunge pool for the hot days.\n\nThe bar and reception is a lovely mix of comfort and efficiency.\n\nThe staff throughout the hotel were all very helpful and friendly, particularly Genesis who helped with directions and possible places to visit ie Poblenou  beach and always had a smile.  Alvarez and Sonia also were very helpful and too always had a smile.\nWe would also like to mention the friendly Michelle and Louise in the dining room and thank them for their tireless efforts.\nWe would highly recommend this H10 central hotel.",

      "text": "Absolutely loved my city break here. Booking directly got a discount of 5%, was greeted with cava on check in. Room of decent size, comfy bed, luxurious  Rituals toiletries. Plenty of storage space, safe, daily complimentary supply of bottled water, coffee machine (unlucky for tea drinker:) cookies on the first evening. Wifi worked perfectly. Ask for free slippers and bath robe if needed.\nLocation is difficult to beat, in the middle of the Gothic quarter, just few steps from the Cathedral and literally beside the metro Jaume I station, in easy walking distance to all main sights of the Old town, abundant dining options around.\nCannot comment breakfast as i didn’t take it in the hotel.\nNoisy street cleaners awakened me in the early hours of the first night. I wrote a complain through the hotel’s app as i had 3 more nights to go. The problem was solved very smoothly, reception staff went above and beoynd to make my stay comfortable. I packed my things, left them in the room and ventured out. New room on the higher floor in the back of the hotel was ready with my luggage there waiting when i came back later in the afternoon. \nWould stay again with no hesitation.",
