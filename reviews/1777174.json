      "text": "We returned to this hotel for the second time, selecting a 2-bedroom suite, and once again, our stay was thoroughly enjoyable. The suite itself is spacious, boasting two balconies with lovely views. While the furniture may not be modern, it harmonizes well with the hotel's overall baroque interior style. The reception staff warmly welcomed us, with Milena, affectionately known as the \"red lady,\" standing out for her exceptional kindness. Our rooms were immaculately clean, thanks to Sadik and his team—Noman and Lucy—who ensured that all our needs were met. The culinary offerings at the Villamore restaurant, overseen by Sergio, were truly exceptional. Mr. Rahman/Mr. Ram and the entire concierge team were incredibly helpful in accommodating any requests we had. Furthermore, if you have boys who are enthusiastic about football, they will be thrilled to find facilities available while you enjoy the remainder of your breakfast. At the beach, the staff readily provided towels and umbrellas, assisting with setting everything up for us. While the hotel may be situated a bit far from the town's attractions, the tranquility of the surroundings—especially if your room faces the palm side—more than compensates for this inconvenience.",
