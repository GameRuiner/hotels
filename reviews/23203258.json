We stayed in a standard room with golf course view.\n\nAll the staff are very accommodating, polite and patient. Raman is very pleasant to speak with.\n\nMy friend and I had a few drinks and light bites at Issei, as recommended when we checked in, and Nanette was exceptionally accommodating!\n\nThe room is clean, food taste great (both brunch and light bites we had) and the drinks selection are awesome.",

      "text": "The hotel was quite quiet when we were there which was great, it meant that there weren’t too many people at breakfast at the same time and it was very pleasant. There is a great choice on offer at breakfast time, and the staff there are so nice. The pancakes are made fresh when you order them and they are amazing, we had them every day they were that good. The day before we left the hotel seemed to get a lot busier, and on our last day we went up to the pool, but it’s not a very big pool and there was no space, but the Easter holidays had started so was busier. Before that day we had used the pool every day and there would only be a handful of people there, wouldn’t like to see it when the hotel is full, but for most of our holiday it was great. We asked about playing golf at the Trump international course which you can walk to as i was told they had preferential rates, we enquired and were told the rates, so went a walk to the course to see what it was like. It looked a good course so we thought we would book when we got back to the hotel, but then the person on the desk said the rates were wrong on where he tried to book, so he gave us new rates which were more than double what was quoted the first time, they are the rates that you would get if you booked yourself, so was a bit disappointed in that, in the end we didn’t book. Apart from that it was a good stay, our room was at a corner so we had a view of the golf course and also the villas that are under construction. There is construction all around the hotel but doesn’t really bother you much, you can hear the reversing beepers on the construction vehicles from about 6.30am but we get up early anyway so was no problem. All in all a nice hotel",
