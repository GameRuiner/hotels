      "text": "I feel bad writing this review but in our experience, this was not a 5 star hotel. Maybe the main lobby is since it's so well-kept but the actual rooms we stayed in (two in fact) needed some renovations/repairs badly. \n\nOverall - We must've picked a VERY slow time to go b/c the hotel is incredibly empty. It felt like a ghost town and kind of depressing. Some people would love this but it honestly just made us sad and felt like the employees were just incredibly bored. Though they did try to make the best of it and some of them were super friendly with trying to sell you their services (i.e. great massage that was inexpensive).\n\nLocation - This is not close to Naama Bay and you need to grab a taxi (there is no Uber available) for a 15 minute drive. We did that one day, so we can get the \"beach vibes\" we were hoping for. \n\nBeach - As many have said, the \"beach\" is non-existent. There is a wooden dock you can go on and dive into the Red Sea. Many took advantage of it for snorkeling, which did seem beautiful. \n\nPools - This hotel has a massive amount of pools, which were almost all empty. I'm not much of a pool person, so I didn't take advantage of it.\n\nStaff - Most of the staff were surprisingly surly though once you say hello first, they will smile at you. The staff during the breakfast buffet who cleaned and maintained the seating areas were very nice, but definitely not the cooks/chefs. The housecleaning staff was also very kind.\n\nFood - On the first night, we arrived late and ordered room service (burger and pasta). Luckily it was inexpensive but not the most delicious. It was definitely fine but I wouldn't recommend room service. We only paid for the breakfast buffet and again, b/c the hotel was very empty, it seemed they only put out a small amount of food options, which was fine. I hate wasting food, so I get it. The breakfast options were fine for a continental spread of options though nothing notable. They do have someone making omelettes, so that's always a plus!\n\nRooms - Yikes! On the first night, we were placed in a room that was very dated (i.e. think 1970s Miami vibes) and had a very old bathroom. The shower had corroded hardware and the grout was not clean looking. There was also some strands of hair. I was horrified and asked the front desk for another room. Since it was late at night, they said they could only move us the next morning. The second room, was a few doors down and was more renovated than my 70s room. The hotel renovated the shower area and we were thankful to see it was clean. However, later that day, we noticed a foul smell near the toilet and there was water leaking somewhere on the wall though we couldn't figure out how/where it came from. There was just a random puddle of smelly water. We were too tired to keep complaining and honestly, was just happy that housecleaning cleaned it up daily. \n\nIf we ever go back to Sharm, this hotel would not be the place we choose to go back to. I'm sure it had its glory days but now isn't it. I truly hope they make the necessary renovations to give new clients a better experience.",

      "text": "We had an incredible week at Jolie Ville Golf Resort.\n\nThe hotel, pools, grounds and beach are beautiful and very nicely done. \n\nThe food was really good too and the staff couldn't do enough for you... We were treated so well. We loved the a la carte restaurant aswell\n\nThe hotel was very quiet (maybe 5% full) which was fine for us but sad for the hotel. \n\nThe only downside for us is that the beds are very hard. They did swap us rooms and upgrade us to Royal but to be honest the bed was exactly the same mattress \n\nLots of people like a firm bed so wouldn't be a problem, but I have hypermobility and really struggled to get comfy and my back suffered \n\nI did have a few Thai massages though... Which were incredible and sorted me right out! Brutal massage but honestly the most effective in terms of fixing pain that I've ever had! \n\nMy partner played a bit of golf... It's not cheap and was also very quiet on the course. He said course was OK, could do with a bit of work. It's the only course in sharm though. \n\nWe both really did love the hotel and we would love to go back, if only they had softer mattresses. \n\nOther than that it was just idyllic",
