      "text": "Have stayed here before and it’s our go to hotel stay in Dubai. We always stay here in a big group as it is amazingly priced with the best view of the Marina. The rooms are very clean and the beds are so comfortable with a big living room and big kitchen space. Would recommend to anyone staying here no matter the occasion. There’s also a small Carrefour at the entrance so is easy if you ever need anything. The city manager Viktoria was so lovely and helpful aswell! We can’t wait to come back again",

I like to mention Janus from reception and generally the people who assisted us while we are in residence.

The hotel is dated and need of an upgrade urgently, couldn’t believe that a hotel like this exists in Dubai and that they won an award this year for best hotel, all I can say is they didn’t look at room 901!!\nOther concerns are building work going on for sometime who work days & some nights, only affected one night but there is also a mosque who have a loud speaker so for light sleepers it’s an early morning alarm at 5.30am to 6am.",
