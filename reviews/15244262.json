      "text": "This is the 4th time I've stayed in this hotel and hopefully not the last. All the staff are so helpful and friendly. I usually request the same room and the manager has always done his best to oblige.\nThe food is a good is a good standard and there's plenty to choose from. \nThe house reef is brilliant to snorkel from or dive. \nMy only one grumble is the gym. I usually use the gym every evening. The equipment has improved over the years with the addition of dumbells, however there is green flooring like fake grass which has been there for years. It gets hoovered however it would be very difficult to clean. \nIt would be great to see something more hygienic on the floor like linoleum or floor boards which can be mopped easily. \nThere is also no aircon, only fans which just circulate hot air. \nThe gym is the only downfall to whole hotel. Sorry to raise this but I am a bit of a gym goer on holiday. The rest of the hotel excels in every other area and I'll always return.",

Lovely view of the sea and beautifully kept gardens.\n\nPool area:\nIs kept very clean!! The lads who hand out towels are great Esmail looked after us so well a great asset to the hotel, very approachable and so polite.\n\nThe restaurant: \nThe food is very good, even if you’re a fussy eater you will always find something to tempt the taste buds!! Plenty of fish, chicken and the beef was cooked so perfectly. They do vary it quite a lot gorgeous cooked prawns and lovely sweet & Sour\nThe food is always well presented and they take the utmost care a lot of pride. Ahmed you should be commended.\nWe were well looked after by the waiting staff who never stop!! John, Baseem always took care of us.\n\nAnimation:\nAlways had something on water Aerobics, water polo, yoga.\nAlways had something on in the evening for an hour or so but then you can go into Soho Square or just sit round and chat.\n\nBar service:\nAmghad and his staff second to none well looked after, you can always have a laugh with them and they are good fun!! Just what you want on holiday. \n\nThe hotel is close to Soho Square a shuttle bus goes from 8pm so if you don’t want to walk or you can’t it’s ideal.\n\nWould I stay again?\nYes without a shadow of doubt.\nIf it’s your first time to Egypt give it a go you won’t be disappointed.\nThere are a lot of other nationalities but I didn’t mind that at all.\n\nI would also like to thank the GM Mr Tarek who runs a very well organised hotel.\n\nSpecial thanks again for looking after us \nMuhommed\nJohn\nAmghad \nBaseem\nEsmail\n\nSee you again in the not so distant future",

      "text": "4* The Hotel is clean and the beds are comfy. A short trip from the airport too. \n\nI visited with my mum for a quick getaway before I get married to my fiancé this year.\n\nCheck-in was smooth and we were shown how to use the safe. The safe won’t fit a laptop in, so keep this in mind. Only small items. \n\nBassem, the restaurant Manager is friendly and more than happy to help. Tables were cleaned promptly so even when busy, we could find a seat. \n\nThe only thing I would complain about is one member staff in the restaurants. His behaviour was disrespectful. The male staff, only there in the evening, behind the pasta station behaving inappropriately.  Laughing at me speaking to his colleague in a different language and then went out of his way to step out from his station and get behind me. Got a good look at my behind to check if he could see beneath my dress and looked me from bottom to top. Then laughed. \n\nHe is lucky my fiancé was not there as he would have complained. \n\nAbsolutely disgraceful behaviour. The same guy discriminated and only gave us a few shrimps on seafood night whilst he gave 2 Russian ladies, a whole plate food each. \n\nThis ruined our night.\n\nOther than that. The restaurants have plenty of fresh salads and fruits to choose from. Highly recommend the rice pudding in the morning and fresh orange slices from the dessert section. \n\nThere was a bit of a language barrier at the towel hut at the pool. It turns out you can have fresh towels once a day so make sure you’re done with your towels before handing them in. \n\nVisiting in March, the big pool can feel quite cold to start with but once you are in and get moving it’s quite refreshing. \n\nThe staff at Reception are happy to help in regards to a late check out. It usually costs $24 to extend your check out time to 3pm. \n\nThe hotel gym was small but did the job and is open from 9am-8pm. \n\nSoho Square is an 11-minute walk down from the hotel or you can get a free shuttle between the hours of 8 pm-11 pm. They arrive every half hour. You can find many shops that sell ‘designer copy’ clothes, shoes and bags. \nBe careful though, as they hike up prices if you are from the UK. I’d recommend visiting Cotton House as Adem, the shop owner was very reasonable. \n\nOverall, I was pleased with my stay here at Grand Oasis. I would recommend staying here if visiting Sharm El Sheikh but I would be careful of the evening staff’s behaviour, especially if you are a female travelling alone or without a partner with you.",
