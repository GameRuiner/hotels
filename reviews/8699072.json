      "text": "It was an amazing stay at Kouros! The whole crew was so nice to everyone and always in a good mood. The rooms are very spacious and have good beds and bathroom. The swimmingpool is a bit cold if you ask me, but that’s subjective. \nThe food is also very good, two different menu’s, one at the pool bar and one at their own restaurant. Maybe a good comment would be to add a bit more vegetarian options for the main course.\nWe also took a very good massage at their boutique spa. Yiannis did a very good job and knew exactly what he did.\nMaybe till next time!",

      "text": "We could not fault the hotel. It’s very quirky and modern, congratulations to whoever the architect was. There are many relaxing areas, deep padded sunbeds, and you can use both pools at Kouros Exclusive, and Home and Suites. We had a room with our own private pool. It was modern and spacious, the beds were so comfortable, and it was a lovely touch having a chocolate left on your pillow each night. The staff on reception and the cleaners were lovely and always wore a smile to work. We ate at the snack bar, which we thoroughly enjoyed, however we thought Terra Med was very overpriced for what it was and were disappointed with our meal and the service . This comes from a couple who are used to London prices. That said, young George did his best to put things  right. One of the benefits of Kouros is that a number of supermarkets are 1-2 minutes walk away and you’re only about 3 minutes from Anthony Quinn Bay where there are loads of beach side tavernas. We loved the traditional Greek food in them.  We were lucky to have car hire so saw most of the island and also took a boat to Symi Island which was absolutely stunning. The breakfast was amazing, loads of choice and we especially loved the home made granola. ",

The bathtub was not finished, but we weren't going to use this anyway, since the shower was perfect. \nWe had a private swimmingpool on our balcony which was great. \nThe staff is very helpful. I would 10/10 recommend to book a massage with Yiannis if you have the time (or 2 or 3..) best massage I ever had. \nThe food in the restaurant is really good, both a la carte menu and sushi. Breakfast is really complete. Probably one of the best hotels I ever stayed at. We might be back ;) ",

The extended renovations are amazing over 20 swim up pool rooms and 3 main pools. The lunch was divine...my friend had smashed burger and I had chicken gyros...absolutely delicious. Cocktails & Mocktails were fabulous. The sun loungers are varied and so comfortable. In the evening we ate sushi at Terra Med the Japanese salad was too die for. The owners are very hospitable and staff professional and welcoming. We are planning our 4th visit for next year! ",
