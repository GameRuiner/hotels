A few minutes walk from the metro with fast, easy, cheap access to waterfront, Dubai shopping mall, the souks, the creek and the airport - so no need for those expensive airport taxis. At a reasonable price. There are several Kingsgate hotels in the same area - so get the right one. I wish I could find a hotel like this everywhere I go.",

      "text": "THIS COULD is our WORST EXPERIENCE EVER for any booking we had through booking.com!!! This Hotel ruined our family vacation in every possible way and showing no will to cooperate or help solve the problem. First of all as soon as we arrived we were shocked that the room comes without closets, and the beds are too small and we are staying for 10 days WITH A BABY!! The hot water wasn’t running and they couldn’t fix it until now and the TV is not working oh and to our surprised the crib the brought for the baby was broken which would have exposed our baby to a great danger!!! We went down to the manager Sebastian asking him to help us get a bigger room so we can have more space for our clothes and the baby and given all the problems with the previous room he gave us very high rates and kept saying he will get back to us and took our mobile number and never did!! We reached out again to tell him we will take a connecting room and we want the hotel give us a good rate since our budget for the trip doubled because of the situation and again he gave us very high rates!!! Finally we told them we will take the room because we were unable to sleep ONLY to be told that they have no rooms for us!!!! we have been suffering and not sleeping and really it’s a nightmare staying at this Hotel this way below Dubai standards and any standards for this matter",

      "text": "What a shame! Prices were significantly higher these days so I had a little higher expectations from the new hotel. And had mixed experiences over the two days I stayed here. I’d like to openly share them hoping the place learns from this. Whilst I arrived rather late (9pm approx) the gentleman in reception was extremely accommodating and helpful with my needs, phone charging and all. Being 5 months pregnant and checking in due to emergency I’d was praying for friendly staff, and he was. He allowed me to have my talabat orders come to my room, and he was helpful.  However, the next day was downhill from there, starting with the disappointment at breakfast, my 2 day booking wasn’t on the list which meant I my room confirmation wasn’t on the breakfast list, the lady checking could barely speak English and zero Arabic. I had a nightmare asking for a decaf coffee from the Starbucks coffee stand they have, she couldn’t understand what decaffeinated coffee was and keep repeating “teacaf” and holding up teabag box to me. I repeated several times I’m pregnant and would like a decaffeinated cafe latte please, waste of time. She understood nothing. Whilst eating breakfast at 9:30-10:15 the drilling and renovation works began in lobby. Extremely loud drilling whilst the 20+ of us were eating breakfast. I had to politely ask them to stop or I’d have to check-out immediately. They did! \n\nLater that night I ordered Talabat food to the room and security refused him to even enter the lobby, he wasn’t allowed to bring my order to the reception and we argued with the reception that the previous day was fine, was today wasn’t?  I also requested additional pillow on the bed, and was told at main reception to call house-keeping. Which I called for the entire time and no one ever answered the phone, not room service, not house keeping and not operations from my room to request additional pillow?\n\nThere are some very good staff working in the building who’re extra helpful at breakfast and in the evenings. The gentleman were all very friendly, but the ladies were not. Shame really! \n\nThe bed was reasonable, not the most comfortable as it’s two twin beds joined together but was ok, AC was strong and hot water, next to the canal for a morning/evening walk. Parking in the basement but overall I’m afraid this is a 3*** budget category hotel. Ideal for 1-2 nights single person, business travels, people who just want somewhere to rest their heads and shower. \n\nThere is a rooftop pool but closes at 6pm, and the hotel offers room-service but if no one answers the phone you won’t be able to have it.",
