The location of the hotel is gorgeous, in Naama Bay itself, everything is within walking distance, the hotel itself is old and needs renovation, but the concept of the hotel is interesting, the houses are like small bungalows. There is very little food, only rice and chicken... At the reception there is a nice girl named Sarah, always friendly and very nice, also a huge thank you to the animators, they made up our days, there was everything, Zumba, exercises, yoga and even going to the club. There are also evening shows, from animators or custom ones, in general you wonâ€™t get bored",
