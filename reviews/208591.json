      "text": " I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest acceptable solution in this ridiculously overpriced city. The cost was about 170€/night without breakfast.\n The location was great, exactly on Las Ramblas and Plaza Cataluna. The building is very old. My room was extremely small (problem if you have 2 suitcases). There was a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. The bathroom was small also.\n I didn't try the breakfast since there are thousands of options around.\nSummarizing, the reasons to choose this hotel is the location and the price (nothing else).\n",

They have a secure luggage room if you arrive earlier than check in time or if you want to leave your luggage there after you have checked out. We had a room overlooking La Rambla and it wasn't too noisy. Great find, we highly recommend.",
