      "text": "We came with our 4 years old son for 9 nights. The hotel swimming pools are great. Our 4 years old son loves the swimming pools, there is a water slide for the children. Very nice children's swimming pool. The beach is peaceful and pleasant. The staff is very child friendly and polite.\n\nThe housekeeping has been amazing so far. Yhe breakfast is amazing with many choices.\n\nThe Amaseena and Blue Jade restaurants have delicious food and spotless service. Splendido restaurant served us delicious food on the first evening, however on the second evening we went, it was awful, the food was inedible, we waited for the food for one hour, I had to follow up a few times as some of the food we ordered did not arrive. They did apologize but to be honest I have never seen such poor service and food. The adults bar on the beach is great. Be aware you are not allowed at the beach bar if you are less than 21 years old.\n\nThe swimming pool and beach service could be better. The towels and water are not bought to you unless you ask for it. And sometimes even when asking they are not provided. For an hotel of this standing, the service at the pool is lacking. One of the safeguard at the water slide is not always attentive, the others are great.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. We can hear the birds singing. The gardens are very pretty. The only minus is the construction site that is pretty noisy next door.\n\nMy husband did not manage to get a tennis coach during the day during the weekdays.\n\nI think there should always be a minimum of 2 staffs at the kids club for safety reasons and some of the ladies working there should stop looking at their phone and focus more on interacting with the children.\n\nWould I come back with my son and husband? Likely. Is it good value for money? Not really. Would I come back with my husband only or by myself? Definitely not.",

I would like to mention a few people, starting with Mr. Marco, the receptionist, for his amazing service. Mr. Faisal, the luggage gay, is also very nice and kind; he helps carry my baby and small bag every day and always smiles. And Mr. Sachit Negi provided fantastic room service for an hour, and he was very clean and considerate of my needs. I never once called to ask for anything more, and the four days were wonderful and amazing. I will repeat my experience 100 times because of the exceptional performance of the leadership and management. They have a skilled and excellent workforce",

Vanessa the manager was so lovely too- went out of her way to help us and make it memorable. She has trained her staff so well. Overall I can't rate this place high enough. Please come and visit. ",

      "text": "The ritz isn’t a cheap hotel, the brand is known for its luxury and this hotel in Dubai lives up to its name. A few days before I arrived I received a call from the hotel asking for flight details to ensure room would be ready, confirming the room set-up and so on. From the moment I arrived until I left the service was amazing, attention to detail, friendly, I could go on. What the staff are very good at is remembering the guests, from my 2nd day at breakfast the staff knew I liked to sit outside, that I always got a black coffee & sparkling water. Down at the beach they remembered I always wanted the sun bed in the shade. These things might seem small but that level of attention is also why you pay these prices. I also saw how they dealt with other guests and their requests, again nothing was too much. For example I saw 1 guest say his kids loved avocado toast so wanted some avocado he could mash for the kids and put on their toast. Within a couple of mins out came plates of fresh avocado toast from one of the chefs that had been prepared. \n\nI came for a couple of days of relaxation after a busy work period & I got that. The rooms are large and spacious, extremely quiet, sun beds were always available. I never used the pool as they are designed more for families but the kids looked like they were having a great time. I liked that bottles of water in a cooler were provided when you used a sun bed and they never skimped on towels. If you don’t fancy eating at the hotel it’s on the walk so there are plenty of places to eat but I mainly stuck to the hotel and wasn’t disappointed.",
