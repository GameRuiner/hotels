The  kindness and friendliness of the Staff are amazingly impressive.\nThe room was not so huge though it‚Äôs clean, tidy and away from the noise which is makes me sleep deeply.\nWe stayed for 4days and 3nights as I extended our days there because it‚Äôs affordable and to explore more places in Dubai with my guest. I would like to THANK YOU as well for the complementary CAKE on my BIRTHDAY ‚ù§Ô∏è really appreciated.\nHoping that you may continue your excellent service and helpful staff.",
