The entire team are great and I would like to thank them all for making my stay so pleasurable, there are too many names to mention however I would like to call out a few team members, Mr Abd El Moneim El Samahy, Front Office Manager, Husain in Housekeeping who serviced my room, Mohammed, who kept my drinks topped up next to the infinity pool, the Assistant F&B Manager who arranged the dinner reservations, the lunch team in the Steak and Shimmers restaurants and the brilliant barman in the Vanilla Bar, a star performer, apologies I didnâ€™t remember all your names personally.\nSince my last visit in November 2023, see previous reviews, the Spa has opened, yes, its opened after all these years, but not fully operational, but a move forward, see attached photoâ€™s. In addition the beach has been extended out into the sea, in particular in front of the Captains Bar with lots of new loungers.\nIn summary another great holiday, lovely hotel, friendly team members and good hospitalityâ€¦..hope to see you soon ðŸ˜Š",
