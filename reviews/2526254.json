      "text": "OK hotel close to beach but threadbare carpets and fun with the lifts spoiled the stay.\n\nThe lobby of the hotel is too small for the amount of rooms and trying to figure the way to your room when leaving the lifts was fun!\n\nRestaurant was OK. Most of the services (pool etc) are in the Hilton Jumerah Beach. This is across the road. Only there for four days so mostly out and about but something to consider for a longer stay.",
