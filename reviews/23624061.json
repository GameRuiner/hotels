      "text": "We stayed at Rove City Walk with my husband and we were incredibly impressed with everything and it totally exceeded our expectations. First of all, it was the coolest hotel that I’ve ever stayed. It has a unique style with artsy decorations and you feel like you are in a movie set. The lobby area, the dining area was beautifully decorated with objects about music and art. The breakfast was amazing with variety of choices. There were free water at the rooms and at the lobby which was very nice. The amenities were changed regularly and the housekeeping was done every day. The rooms were very clean and the hotel smelled very good all the time. The staff was very helpful and kindly responded to every question we had. Shijith from the travel firm Travel Saga helped us around the tours and we did lots of tours thanks to him. He was very helpful and supportive and he provided us amazing activities and tours. We booked every tour with him and we were more than satisfied with each and everyone of them. We will think of nowhere else but Rove City Walk for our future stays in Dubai and will definitely recommend it to our friends and family. Thank you for everything!",
