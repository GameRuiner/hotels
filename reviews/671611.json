Large with comfortable bed, minibar, clean room and clean bathroom.\nHotel - has a nice feel about it inside.  It is older type of architecture and looks quite nice.\nPool - older style pool with quite basic surrounds but for the cost of the stay to have a pool as well was quite nice.\nFood - we only had breakfast there and it is very basic and not much selection at all but was included in the room price, so no complaints since you can get great local food anywhere.\nWould recommend this hotel if you are just travelling around from place to place and need somewhere to sleep for a night or two.\nA lot of tables near the pool were decorated for what seemed to be a wedding or large reception, but in the evening or next mornig still looked the same and not used.",
