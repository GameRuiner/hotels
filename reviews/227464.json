      "text": "Great stay at hotel Regina. We had a family room and it was a decent size. Robes and slippers were a nice touch. Hotel centrally located with easy walking to a lot of sights. We especially enjoyed lovely breakfast buffet. We would love to recommend hotel Regina Barcelona as a nice option for families to stay while visiting the city.",
