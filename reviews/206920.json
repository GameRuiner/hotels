      "text": "Fantastic hotel and Staff! From the outset our stay was excellent. The front desk team made us feel welcome immediately upon our arrival. Raul gave us lots of local information. The room was a great size and beautifully clean. During our stay we celebrated our anniversary any my husband's birthday. The hotel put sweet treats in our room, a card and balloons, and rung to wish us congratulations. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with so much choice and well laid out. Cooked choices on request.  Pool towels available at the desk.  The pool was chilly, but it is April!, but the setting up on the roof is very pleasant. The hotel is well situated near the Arc D'Triompf  which has a lovely walk through / round it , and also a metro station ( 3mins from hotel ).  It is well placed for getting around Barcelona,  about 15/20 mins walk to Gothic part, but honestly we walked to a lot of sights from the hotel. We used the metro line too, which is very easy to follow too. If you don't have your room cleaned for a day, they then give you a voucher for a free drink from the bar ( one for each person in the room). We got a later check out on \"lazy Sunday\" ,which meant we could enjoy a full morning in the city , and found more things we hadn't already seen. After checking out you can leave your luggage there securely and go out more if your flight isn't until later ( you can also use the pool if you want) - this was very helpful.    Would definitely stay here again on a return trip to BCN. Thank you to all staff, including the bar staff, the serving staff, and the cleaning team.",

      "text": "I honestly can't fault this hotel. We stayed 3 nights with my 80 year old mother, 17 year old son and 14 year old daughter and it worked brilliantly for all ages. The staff bent over backwards to be helpful, nothing was too much trouble and made our stay there an absolute joy. The rooms were spacious and very well appointed. Perhaps the only small complaint if I had to find one was that if you have a corner room they are bit cramped and if you have the window open it is difficult to reach one side of the bed, particularly with a side table in the way. The other two rooms we had were outstanding. Lovely touch was having coffee and tea making facilities and water bottles replaced every day. My son turned 17 while we were there and they left balloons and cakes in his room! \n\nWe opted for breakfast in the hotel and it was superb. Probably the best I have had anywhere and a lovely dining room too. I am gluten free and there were lots of options. \n\nThey had an excellent concierge called Hugo who helped us book restaurants and trips and contacted us via WhatsApp to confirm or make changes. Again, nothing was too much trouble. \n\nA lovely touch as you walked in the door was a refreshment table with cold drinks infused with lemon, mint etc. \n\nWe ordered food twice and again, this was exceptional. \n\nThe rooftop pool was beautiful and I just wish we had had more time to enjoy it!\n\nWe will be back for sure!",

      "text": "Nice welcome to a hotel which is handily placed for access to metro lines and some of Barcelona's attractions.  Unfortunately the great welcome was not replicated through the rest of the stay with a sense of feeling that guests were an inconvenience to hotel staff.\n\nRoom was ok, did the job and bed was comfortable.\nPlenty for breakfast, although lacking in hot options readily available (you have to ask for hot breakfast, and some of the staff didn't seem to be overly approachable).\nHad a meal in the restaurant which was rather disappointing for the quality of hotel and the cost of the meal itself.  \n\nMassive bugbear was that we were told for additional coffee, tea and milk for the room you had to pay a 1 euro charge for each item (first time have ever had this in a hotel).  Presumably this is because of the coffee capsules, but as this is the only coffee that was offered in the room (no instant sachets) it's a complete con.  On checking out we queried this again and was told you get three a day for free if you have the room serviced daily, although as you are encouraged not to,  to help reduce 'environmental impact' with the offer of a free bar drink, how are you supposed to get additional coffee etc for the room when you are told you have to pay for each item.\n\nAlthough the costs are minor, guests don't like being used as a cash cow.  \n\nA disappointing experience. Such a shame, could be such a great hotel.",

      "text": "Loved everything about this hotel, the rooms were spacious and well equipped, the facilities inc exclusive use of a sauna (we used it everyday!), and the staff were so helpful with every request we had.  The hotel even had a ‘green policy’ which meant that you got a free drink in the bar if you didn’t get your room cleaned for a day.  Good incentive!! 😆",
