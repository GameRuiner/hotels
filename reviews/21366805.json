The free breakfasts are delicious, available long enough that you can wake up late and still eat, and show case the diverse nature of the area by offering many options to choose from. We especially enjoyed the different kinds of fresh juice every morning. We were able to readily use a taxi app to get from the Element to any where in Dubai and back each day. Finally, when my flight was canceled, they were extremely patient and accommodating while I figured out my next steps, and with only an hours notice they extended my stay and kindly kept me in my same room.
