      "text": "This review is a mixed bag. Firstly, the positives‚Ä¶.\n\nThe staff at the restaurant, reception and Sky Bar are wonderful and can‚Äôt do enough for you. A special mention to Roukia in the restaurant and Mohamed in the Sky Bar, as they should be praised for their level of customer service. \nThe grounds are  very pretty & beautifully maintained and it was very easy to find sun beds near the beach. It‚Äôs not a beach by the way, you can really only  access the water from  the piers\n\nThe room was adequate and clean\n\nNow the negatives‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nOur biggest complaint was the quality of the food. \nBreakfast was acceptable but lunch and dinner was just awful!! .There was absolutely no ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù and whilst the cold food (salads /desserts) were ok, it was the ‚Äúhot‚Äùfood‚Äù  that was definitely 1* at best!! It was lukewarm to cold most days, watery and lacking in flavour of any kind.  The soup, some nights  resembled watery stock. If you went to eat an hour into service, many dishes had gone and weren‚Äôt replaced.\n\nThis hotel is badly let down by its food so if you are expecting 4* or 5* food, don‚Äôt go here.",

The resort and its crew left an amazing impression on us, showing top-notch service at every turn. It is with great pleasure that I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to others.\n\nI would love to recommend the photographer Amgad. His office is located near the reception area. Amgad was honestly such an amazing photographer and we are so satisfied with the pictures he took. He also had the kindest heart, and made us so comfortable when taking the photos. \n\nI also wish to extend my gratitude to Shrook, a delightful member of the restaurant staff. Her warm hospitality and infectious smile added to the enjoyment of our dining experience. We extend our best wishes to her for continued success.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of Omar, who diligently prepared our suhoor meals during the Ramadan period. His attentive care and genuine kindness ensured that our needs were met with utmost consideration.\n\nWe are really impressed with the activities team too. They kept us entertained with all sorts of fun stuff throughout our stay. Their energy and creativity really added to the whole experience.\n\nAnd last but definitely not least, Mohamed, our room cleaner. Our rooms were spotless, thanks to him. Plus, he'd make these cute towel animals and bring us flowers. \n\nSeriously, if you're looking for an amazing resort experience, this place and these people are the real deal.",

      "text": "The Truth \nIf you are an English couple please be advised we are definitely not catered for I have no idea why British airways has this hotel on their listings cause I would not recommend it. The hotel grounds are beautiful, the staff are lovely but that‚Äôs it. Food was terrible especially in their so called A La Carte restaurants, drinks are watered down I actually lost weight in 9 days. The sun loungers around the pool are awful nobody really uses them uncomfortable and old. \nI could continue with the grips but I think you get the idea.",
