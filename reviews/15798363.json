The rooms are fantastic and I would recommend the Stone Rooms as they have a lovely seating area outside. The food is fantastic and obviously the wine is of the highest quality. Even if you chose not to stay at 10GR it is a worth a visit for drinks and dinner. I certainly will be back again as will many of our clients ",

This hotel is built into the old walls of this medieval city but has all the modern amenities that you will need.  The service was great, staff friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and our rooms were spacious (I stayed in the Junior Suite).  Rates were very reasonable (we were there in the offseason) which included breakfast and 10% off dinner.   We ate there two nights and the meals were great.  You won't go wrong with this hotel.",

From the pick up, at the gate, in their golf buggy, to check in, the breakfasts, and the lovely Greek gin night caps. \nThe staff are absolutely brilliant. So friendly and helpful. \nThe standard rooms are small, but perfect, with really comfortable beds and a cute seating area outside. You can request have your breakfast there, but I loved sitting outside on the cobbled street, soaking up the atmosphere of the old town, to have mine. \nThe location was perfect in the the heart of everything, but peaceful at night. \nIt was our first visit to Rhodes, and we were in the old town for 3 nights. Unfortunately we didnâ€™t have time to eat an evening meal, or try their wine tasting, as there is so much to see and do. \nI did however see a big group wine tasting whilst there, and it looked so much fun. \nWe will definitely be back to Rhodes, and the 10GR, so look forward to trying both then.
