All the staff were super friendly and greeted us with a smile:) Robert was very helpful accommodating us during our check in and also we met him at the end of our stay. \nDuring our visit we had access to l’apéro for the daily afternoon tea and the pre dinner buffet. The food was delicious and the cocktails super yummy. The amenities were very good and the breakfast had always many options to enjoy! This is definitely a great place to enjoy and we will definitely go back!",
