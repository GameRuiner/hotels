You are able to visit many areas of the ship and are allowed free time to roam at the end of the tour. Whilst the feel of the ship is much different to that when you sailed upon her, it is very worthwhile visiting this grand lady to reminisce.",

      "text": "We planned to go as 4 families for Eid and contacted customer service. It was too poor a service. What they have mentioned online is different. After I booked they sent a message that breakfast and dinner is for 2 adults only and not children. When I sent the screenshot , later they edited it online. And for that service they should ideally compensate by including the dinner and breakfast for them too. And again the next day in WhatsApp they mentioned different rooms with different package with food for all 4 ppl but again they refused it’s a wrong message. For booking of 4 families , I have invested 2-3 hrs calling them , messaging them , mailing them and no resolution given. Ms.jacqueline was kind enough to find a solution but it was too late by then. It’s a horrible service and the rate went high after I booked and it seems they want me to cancel the lower rate and they increased the price for somebody else due to high demand. We working in a corporate planned our event of 60 ppl coming here too later which I had to cancel now due to this experience. Highly recommended to avoid for families. Maybe for a couple it can work. My first ever bad review for a hotel in lifetime",
