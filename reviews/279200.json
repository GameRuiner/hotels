We ended up cutting our losses and checking out early and stayed in a hotel closer to the airport.",

      "text": "It was not bad but if I go to Barcelona again I will probably choose a different hotel. A few pros and cons based on personal experience:\nPros: 1. some rooms are renovated with very useful facilities, such as usb chargers on night stands and desk. Yes, only some rooms and I will explain how I got to know that. 2. The rooms are relatively newer as compared to the other 5 hotels we stayed throughout the trip around Spain. 3 location is very convenient. 4. Most staff were super helpful except for one, which I will mention below. 5 there is a second door between the beds and the small walkway after entering the room, which helps to block noises from elevator, neighboring guests talking in public hallways, doors slamming, etc. it’s very functional for light sleepers.\nCons: 1. Noise and one irresponsible staff. I was traveling with a 76 year old parent and specifically asked for a quiet room away from main Street. During checkin, I asked clearly if the room was facing away from busy Street and got positive confirmation. After getting into the room, I noticed the window opened into a street but I was not clear minded after a 18 hour flight and mistakenly thought it was a small street. That day happened to be the Barcelona rose and book holiday and the street was vehicles free and somewhat noise free as well. 1st night was peaceful due to blocked traffic. 2nd night was a all-night symphony of traffic noises, kids screaming, parties on the street, sirens, etc. I came to realize we were indeed right opening to the corner of de Gracia. My elderly parent didn’t have a second of sleep after a long haul flight. We had to go asking for a room change and this time a different gentleman at front desk was very helpful to move us to a room facing the other side.\n2. Between the two rooms one has usb and other other doesn’t. But even the one doesn’t look newly renovated. So it’s kinda random.\n3. Room is on the smaller side but we knew it when booking so it was not a big deal.\n4. Wi-Fi was very weak in both rooms and I was glad I purchased a cell phone card with enough data.",

      "text": "We arrived to our room, exhausted and ready to gather ourselves. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a distracted and inattentive host.  The amount of information offered initially about our stay was lacking.  I had to pull basic things out of them like access to the WiFi, location of breakfast, and time of checkout. When we arrived at our room (1st floor past the elevators) we were surprised at how dirty the room was. There was hair on the sheets, dirty towels in the bathroom, and woman sanitary items in the trash. We promptly went back to the front desk to asked for another room. They could not accommodate our request. They did come by and agreed the room needed cleaning. The first impression given has been tough to overcome. The WiFi is spotty, or non existent.",

What they don’t tell you on the website is that they have rooms on the same floor as their restaurant and next to the cleaning supplies room, separated from the restaurant by one door !!!!!! And the noise started at 6 am with the cleaning lady SLAMMING the door of the cleaning supplies room every few minutes until I was woken up and couldn’t sleep again. That plus the NOISE from the restaurant itself. I was thus SO TIRED for the rest of the day, complained to the front desk and vowed NEVER to stay at this TERRIBLE hotel again.",
