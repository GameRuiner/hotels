This is the first time I’m experiencing a pedestrianised Dubai and it’s wonderful. We’re staying for three months (Jan-Apr) and don’t want to leave! \n\nThe staff go above and beyond every single day (a special thank you to Danda and Sabin for always taking care of us). The restaurant’s breakfast caters for everyone (healthy options aplomb) and its terrace overlooking the golden mile is peaceful and relaxing. \n\nOur 3-bedroom suite is very spacious with large floor to ceiling wardrobes in every room. The amenities are terrific (daily sheets change, everything is clean, the gym is open 24/7, rooftop pool, washer/dryer, black out curtains) and with a toddler and a dog, we’ve had the most seamless stay. \n\nThe Golden Mile race track behind the hotel is always filled with people, dogs, and children. But it’s also never too crowded. If you have a child(ren), don’t hesitate to stay here as there are several playgrounds dotted along the race track and four grocery stores within walking distance (3 in Nakheel and an organics shop on the Mile).",
