They are extremely greatful to him.\nGenerally all staff were polite, professional and were always eager to make your stay special.\nThe hotel has access to a private beach and also has numerous pools. Some of which were heated and all were spotlessly clean and were situated within beautiful and well maintained gardens.\nThe whole hotel offered a very relaxing ambience.\nThere was also plenty of day and evening entertainment with a really motivated team that allowed those who wanted to get involved in all activities.\nUpon leaving we were extremely grateful for an extended check out time which allowed us to use the facilities and freshen up before our long flight home.\nA particular mention needs to go to the staff who made our holiday so memorable, especially at a time when they were themselves participating in Ramadan. \nTheir hard work during what can be a challenging time was greatly appreciated.\nThis hotel is thoroughly recommended for a stay in the Nabqq Area.\nThere are shuttle buses (at a small cost) to other areas, including Soho Square.",
