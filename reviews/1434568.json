      "text": "So many things are absolutely great about this place!   Lets start with all the positives! \n\n Location:  You are on the Marina beach, you are walking distance from the beach, all the restauraunts.  Another thing you are close to is the tram!  It will take you to the Metro which takes you throughout Dubai!  We hardly needed to Careem(or Uber) because of this.\n\nSpace:  So much space!  We are a family of four.  We had in this apartment, 2 spacious bedrooms, one with a king bed, the other with 2 singles(twin in US).  Each room had a wall of cabinets, and a desk.  We had 2 full bathrooms.  And a half bath near the living room.  We had a full dining table and a full kitchen.  We also had a lovely balcony!  Warm breeze each day or night out there, so lovely to sit. Each window in this room opened to gorgeous views!  There was also a washing machine which definitely came in handy.  Also a whole another room, which had only an ironing table and iron in it!  This apartment was super spacious.  And it was very very comfortable.\n\nService: Exceptional.  The staff were friendly, and any request I made was looked after in a jiffy.  They cleaned our apartment everyday.  We stayed in and had late mornings, but they came and cleaned when we went out.  Even washed the dishes.  Also left us 4 water bottles everyday.  This apartment hotel gave us loads of little amenities, from shampoos, to toothbrushes, to sewing kits.  There is a little grocery store right next door that stays open at night, this was super convenient for us too.  A pharmacy is there too.\n\nThe only con I can say is that the place needs refurbishing!  Style wise, everything is great, but like all heavily used hotels, things get tatty pretty quickly.  So is the case here.  Still, I would go again.\n\nAnother little thing I noticed was, though the staff were excellent and they cleaned everyday.   Sometimes the bathrooms were done too quickly.  In one walk in shower on day one there were previous guests hairs on the wall, and throughout our stay they were never cleaned away!  I think the cleaners came and worked on the floors sinks toilets and shower trays, but did not really look at the walls.  \n\nBut I have been to 5 star hotels where i find something icky too.\n\nOverall, for the cost, this is definetly a wonderful place in terms of location, space, and amenities.",
