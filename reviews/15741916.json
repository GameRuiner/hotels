No plastic in the rooms, glass water bottles which were refilled daily, bathroom extras in paper wrappings. We ate at the roof bar one evening, lovely views over Dubai, and welcoming atmosphere. We had tapas style food, all of it really tasty.  For breakfast there was a wide range of choice and enjoyable. Really nice hotel, recommend for business or pleasure.",
