The beach club at the sister hotel was great. The spa is awesome. We had the half-board option which was great, the buffet at SloaneÂ´s has been delightful. We tried a few of the restaurants, our favorite was the Bella Vista. Just be mindful with the mini-bar, I took a little jar of cashew nuts and the price was GBP 15. But I fully whole-heartedly recommend this hotel, I have never had such a relaxing, pleasant holiday. Even after ten days, I feel like I could have stayed on.",
