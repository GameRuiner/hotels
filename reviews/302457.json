      "text": "Our favourite hotel in Dubai and the world. Burj Al Arab truly is the world’s only 7 star hotel. We stayed for a few nights in April this year and had a wonderful stay. \n\nOur butlers Gucci and Maryam were so helpful and could not do enough for us. The hotel was also very helpful over e-butler before we arrived and during our stay. \n\nThe pool area is world class with amazing service and facilities. The wrap around infinity pool was stunning. If you can’t afford to stay at the hotel it is definitely still worth visiting to use the pool area. \n\nBreakfast was also fantastic each day with a large selection of food and you also can order from the al a carte menu which feels like a more premium experience in line with the hotel. \n\nFinally our hotel suite was amazing. So large compared to any other hotel room. We stayed in the 2 bedroom family suite. As a family of 5 this was a perfect room for us with so much space. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning in the near future.",

      "text": "This review is not about the whole hotel but just the UMA Lounge. We were staying at St. Regis Palm but my family wanted to visit the iconic Burj Al Arab. I found a following option on their website: UMA Premium Cabana Reservation for 1,500dirhams (around USD400), maximum capacity 6persons. The amount was redeemable credit to be used. \n\nThe UMA Lounge is a gigantic tourist trap. The menu is a total disaster, not even an attempt to offer something more sophisticated besides Club Sandwich and Pizza Margherita. I am more than happy to pay premium for something special but $40 for a hot chocolate that didnt look or taste anything special?  \n\nStay away from this place, there are hundreds of better places to visit in Dubai.",
