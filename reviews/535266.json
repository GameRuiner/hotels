      "text": "In our opinion, we say that this hotel does not deserve to be recommended. \n\nIndeed, the territory is super. And olny this is reason we rate this hotel 2. The hotel area and the beach are very beautiful, there is availible sunbeds by the pool and the internet (Wi-Fi) is really available as promised. \n\nEverything else leaves much to be desired: The food is very monotonous and tasteless. There is no difference between lunch and dinner, all the same dishes. Eating the same meal for a week is bit annoying.\n\nRooms are tired. We managed without the bidet hose, which was missing, and the flooded floor after every shower, because shower cabin was leaking. However, we would expect the room and towels still to be clean. We needed to contact hotel customer servise rep. to get the room clean and to have everything in the room for the three of us. \n\nStaff attitude was very poor. Not welcoming at all. Bartenders ignored us at the counter. Chatting with eachother or talking on the phone. Drinks were not offered al lunch and not even at dinner!! You must go yourseft to counter and order vine, witch will be served to you in hot glass! \n\nWe know that tipping goes a long way in such countries, but it didn't help here ðŸ«¤ \n\nWe would not recomment this hotel.",
