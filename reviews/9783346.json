      "text": "My experience of staying here was contrasting highs and lows... \nTalking about the lows first. \n\nFront office\nPart 1. \nThe staff at front office is very rude, and unprofessional. I reached this hotel at 1pm, and the standard check in is 2pm. So I quietly waited in the lobby for 50 minutes. At 1:50pm, I walked up to the reception again and politely requested if the room was ready. The guy at the reception told me, \"Please wait, the check in time is 2pm!\" Allowing a 10 minute early check in seemed like a luxury to ask for. I can understand if they tell me that they are trying to get a room ready, but saying that standard check in time is 2pm was very rude. This is at 1:50pm, not like at 11am... \n\nPart 2\nMy booking was through Agoda. Agoda never mentioned that the hotel collects a refundable deposit of AED 200 as a security for any damages. I paid this amount and requested a receipt for this amount, which I understand is also a law in the UAE, that for any payment, I have the right to get a receipt. The front office guy told me that it will take 15 more minutes to get a receipt. At this point, I told him, I have been waiting for 1 hour to get a room, and its 2pm already.. so they should jut give me the receipt, or collect payment of AED 200 later on when they are able to give me a receipt. The guy snatched the room key from my hand, and said that If i want the receipt, I should wait and cannot check in, plus he pointed out to his watch and said its not 2, its 1:57pm.. absolutely unprofessional and rude!. At this stage, another colleague of his intervened, and gave me the receipt and the key back, and I could check in at 2pm.  \n\nPart 3.\nI was given an interconnecting room, where I stayed happily for 2 nights, and even extended my stay at the hotel by another 5 nights (original booking was 1 week). The next day, the guest in the other room was incessantly coughing through the night, and vomitting.. perhaps he was unwell, and I couldnt sleep because of the sound coming through the interconnecting room. Next day, I politely requested to be shifted to another vacant room, so that I can have some privacy and also avoid any potential infection. The front office manager interviewed me, and tried to refute my story... he was trying to prove that I was making some random excuses to move rooms... I asked him to speak with his night duty front office, as I had even reported the matter at night, and only asked for a change after suffering 1 whole night.... finally they did give me the change that i requested\n\nNow for the good experience part\n1. Housekeeping. Excellent service by the housekeeping staff... serving with a smile... always catering to requests... keeping the room clean\n2. Technician... There was a water heater problem and refrigerator problem in the new room.. this was promptly addressed by the technician... and most importantly, without complaints, and again with a big smile on his face.\n\nHow I wish, the front office team learns from the support staff, how to behave with customers. \n\n3. The room size is pretty good, and its really well equipped. Some of the rooms have a balcony too\n\n4. Location is very convenient. Short walk from ADCB metro station and close to restaurants and market of Al Karama.",
