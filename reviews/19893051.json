Pillows and mattresses are very comfortable clean and bed sheets are so comfortable and clean when you sleep you feel so comfortable. Interior of the room and colors they have used very attractive and clean. The housekeeping team is doing an excellent job as the room is very clean and everything inside arranged very neatly. Bathroom with clean towels and clean vanity and modern fixtures which are very attractive. I feel the cleanliness is excellent when I am stepping on the floor. They provide all the amenities what you need, and it was very fast service from housekeeping team whenever I requested something. I have seen they keep clean the carpets everyday morning and I would really appreciate the housekeeping team for keeping the area clean. My room was clean very well by Boran and he was so attentive for my requests and my needs when I am staying there. Overall thank you for the clean bed linen, clean bathroom, clean room as it totally worth paying the rates and staying there. I would like to recommend this hotel to everyone and excellent housekeeping service they provide.",
