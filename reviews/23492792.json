      "text": "Stayed at No. 10 here for 2 nights, location is convenient, super close like 2 mins walk away from Ephesus Archaeological Museum and less than 10 mins walk from main station with bus and taxi. Getting to Ephesus took less than 10 mins by taxi. \n\nNice room and really love all the wood furniture and decoration pieces, clean and comfortable, with a nice little balcony. Staff is friendly. There’s a nice garden area for relaxing and also love the vibe and all the decor in the lobby.\n\nJust one small thing that I noticed which is odd and can be a little gross, the toilet brush is not beside the toilet but far away beside the sink. \n\nOverall great stay and have to say this place is of superb value, value wise it is definitely the best out of 11 places I stayed in Turkey.\n",
