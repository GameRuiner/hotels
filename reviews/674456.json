      "text": "Worst 5 star hotel on Earth, period. We went on a honeymoon, and whenever you pay as much as we did, you’d expect everything to be perfect (it costs as much as the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, which we also went to, and its a dream hotel). \nWell…it was far away from that. Actually, it was far away from acceptable. \nNobody on the reservation warned us that they would change times and other things because of the Ramadan (all the other hotels we checked do). \nThe room just feels outdated. \nThey try to push a car that costs 3 times as much as a regular taxi every time you leave the hotel. \nBut nothing beats the horrible attention from the staff. We have experienced a terrible disappointment at the pool. \nWith staff telling us to leave one part of the pool because they were assembling tables for the Ramadan Iftar. But worse than that, was a family doing an absurd noise (including using speakers on the pool!!! Absurd!!!) and they weren’t doing nothing!!! I had to go to the General Manager upstairs to complain so they’d do anything. What succeeded I won’t even bother telling (already had a discussion with Yousef, the Manager, and Ahmad, the security staff). \nIf I could give zero stars, I would. \nThe only thing that’s good there is the view. \nAtt.,\nDaniel",
