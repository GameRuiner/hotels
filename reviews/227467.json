      "text": "We arrived late to Barcelona. The free hotel shuttle picked us up as expected and on time. Check in was pleasant, even with tired kids, and the room was great - clean, spacious enough and we had a cool room configuration - a king bed and 2 twin bunk beds - perfect for our family. The staff was friendly, including the bartender downstairs.  Great service - they went above and beyond to return my AirPods that I left behind in the room - housekeeping found my headphones and the hotel mailed them back to the U.S. for me! No fuss, no upcharge, nothing. I provided my credit card and shipping was $11 USD. Great experience, nice amenities, clean and super service!",

Mahfud, who checked us in, was super nice and gave us a free upgrade and a couple of vouchers for a drink at the bar, which was open late.  The free shuttle to the airport worked out great.\n\nThe only strange thing about the room is that there was no door between the bathroom and the rest of the room, so anybody using the toilet was exposed.  I'm not sure if every room is like that or just ours, but something to think about if you are staying with somebody that you may not have that kind of relationship with.",

The Mercabarna (largest wholesale food market) site is located right next door and we receive many guests for work reasons aswell many other guests stay at this hotel for different reasons given the quantity and quality of events in Barcelona. \n\nLikewise, the Natural Park of the Delta del Llobregat can be explored on foot or by bicycles, which can be rented at the hotel. They are very simple walks, without slopes, well indicated, their routes start five minutes from the hotel, highly recommended if you have a little time, if you like nature and if walking is not an inconvenience.\n\nWe hope to have the opportunity to welcome you again.\n\nSincerely\n\n\"Be My Guest\" department\nBest Western Plus Hotel ALFA Aeropuerto \nYour hub between the Mediterranean destinations and home   \n",
