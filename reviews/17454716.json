The rooms are nothing to write home about, but are comfortable and did the job. \n\nWe stayed there for one night. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The breakfast the next morning was quite delicious and hit the spot. We would definitely stay there again if we were in this area of Izmir.",

      "text": "We stayed 4 nights in this hotel which has been recommended by a travel agency. The price which is paid b us 65 usd per night that seems for a such kind hotel it doesn't worth.  In fact, this hotel has both strengths and weaknesses. Weaknesses include a small lobby area and a reception desk. There isn't luggage room  and the breakfast is small and ordinary. The view out of room is not good. Opposite side is  located Grade 3 coffee house. The structure of the rooms is such that sound can be easily heard from the neighboring rooms  and in our suite when in the neighbor room  open shower in bathroom The sound of water is heard in the form of howling.\nStrengths: A relatively good location in the city and access to the city center and the seaside of Aegean sea. Good and polite staff, especially the receptionist Ms. Merich, who greets guests with a beautiful smile. cleanliness is good and Housekeeping does its job well. Actually STONGEST OPTION OF THIS HOTEL IS GOOD STAFF.",

Here are the pros \n\n- nice rooms with basic essentials \n- close to several locations\n- polite staff especially female receptionist who was kind and understanding \n- breakfast was basic\n\nThe not so good things\n- near the roadside with thin walls so you could hear people talking from other room, the corridor or outside the hotel\n- breakfast had very little hot food options\n- parking was free but limited to the road\n- understaffed ( i asked reception for sugar and she said theres no one to deliver and requested if i could come to the lobby to take it)\n- cooling system didnt work most times despite mentioning it several times\n\nOverall our stay was well but could have been much better if the cooling worked and breakfast had more variety\n",
