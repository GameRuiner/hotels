The island was perfectly secluded and views of the Dubai skyline were cinematic. We were in contact with Ralph, our host that evening for the Iftar dinner, and from organising the boat trips and his friendly and sincere attitude towards us, it made us feel very appreciated.",

On arrival we were also upgraded to the beach access suite with a private pool. All of the staff were absolutely incredible and could not have been more helpful. Our son was really unwell on the last night and the team organised an ambulance to island as precaution. Would absolutely recommend the hotel to anyone and we will certainly be back",

Having lived in Dubai for the past three years, this was a great escape for us. The staff were amazing, especially Amir, the reception manager, and his team. Even though they don't have a butler service, they stay in touch with you and make sure your stay is amazing. We wanted to book the cinema under the stars, but it was fully booked. We hope to book it next time. Our host, Aziza, was very helpful, and the room cleaning team was also very friendly. We will definitely come back to enjoy this paradise again.",
