Pooja and her team even went above and beyond to organise a lovely surprise for my son's birthday yesterday - something we will treasure as a lovely memory.

      "text": "We had a lovely 10 night stay here over Easter. \nThe place is kept immaculately clean. The staff are the most pleasant people you will ever meet, they can’t do enough for you. \nWe were there for our anniversary and the staff had put a lovely banner and rose petals on our bed. They also delivered us a thoughtful slice of cake. We were offered a room upgrade, but as we would have to move rooms mid stay, we turned it down. \n\nThe food is plentiful and varied. We did half board. You could use your half board credit, 100AED per adult and 50AED per child, at one of the on site restaurants. Or just eat in the hotel restaurant. \n1) Trader Vics\n2) Vero \n3) Wave breaker (I’ve reviewed all separately)\n\nTrader Vics was my personal favourite! Probably due to the fabulous cocktails!\n\nOur room 463 had a magic view. We enjoyed many evening sitting out on the balcony. \n\nAs with most hotels, the rooms could do with a refurb, esp the bathroom. Also I would have loved a drying rail outside on the balcony for swimwear etc. the string over the bath did very little to dry clothes. \nBut all in all the room was very comfy! \n\nMy only pet peeve with this hotel was “the dance of the sun beds”. The towel hut opened at 8am, and yet at 7am people already had loungers reserved with towels. \nAs there are very few loungers around the pool, we ended up having to play this game too. Due to the fact that we have a 6yr old and needed to be able to see him in the pool. So we had to start setting the alarm to ensure we got a lounger. Not very 5* Dubai behaviour, but needs must. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷‍♀️\n\nDuring our final breakfast we were given a lovely piece of ginger carrot cake, with “see you soon” written below it. Such a wonderfully kind gesture. \n\nWe would definitely come back to Hilton Jumeirah Beach Dubai ❤️",
