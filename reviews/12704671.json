      "text": "We booked 4 rooms in this hotel and our experience has not even been upto the basic mark. As per us hospitality is about understanding the customer needs, however over here they are looting customers at every point of service offerred. The hotel practices are rude and does not leave a good experience especially when one visits a country and proud emirates Dubai, who is known worldwide for their hospitality. This hotel leaves a bad taste, during the time spent in Dubai. We have visited Dubai several times in the past, however never experienced such ignorance and bad service practices. It made us feel that this hotel is only here to make money at every step and not serve guests who are ambasadors from their countries.  The pictures they share on net have a very glossy look, however when we reached the hotel to our surprise there was no view, as it was opposite a graveyard just opposite the hotel and hence all the windows of the hotel are tinted. My family felt we were in some sort of a prison and felt cheated. The food offerred in breakfast was of sub standards, and for the first time in my travelling experience in several countries and hotels when my wife ordered for an omlette, they said it was chargable . Who charges for an omlette for breakfast. When asked housekeeping for a small bottle of water refill the same was chargable. My daughter got hurt as her head banged a table and we asked for few cubes of ice, reply was the same ice is chargable, with no empathy at all. Our door lock was not working and to fix the same we had to do atleast 6-7 rounds to the front desk to get the issue resolved. The hotel does not follow the basic steps of hospitality and is not at all worth the money one spends. Very disappointed with the service and family was pushing me to change the hotel, although payment for 8 nights were made. However being new year times if was difficult to get an alternative hotel room. Extremely disappointed.\n\nSumeet Mahadik.",

It was Very Spacious; had a Dining Table, 2 TVs, Sofa and a Decent Wash Room.\n\nOur first Impression was not very favourble. The Location and the Reception left more to be Desired. But we were 'WOWed' by the Room. Exeptional for the price We paid.\n\nThe Hotel is usaully fully Booked. We saw a big group of 30-40 Kids Checking-out; While we were Checking-in. Hotel seems to be very popular with the Indian Travel Agents. We met mostly Indian Guests in our 2 day Stay.\n\nWe did not get to stay very long at the Hotel as we were very busy with local sight seeing. Hotel most likely has very limited facilities. The Breakfast was fine and had a lot of Indian food. Local Restuarants are near by. \n\nRoom - 10/10\nLocation - 7.5/10\nBreakfast - 7/10\nStaff Behavior - 9/10",
