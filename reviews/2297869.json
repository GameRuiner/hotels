      "text": "I stayed here with my family in a single room over New Year's Eve.  The hotel is a 3-star hotel and was clean and tidy.  The only downside were the walls of our room. They were so thin you could practically have a conversation with the people in the next room.  However it was not conversation that woke us up at 5 in the morning, the couple in the next room were doing their amorous business and were not shy about being loud about it! Banging headboard and the moaning.  This might've been funny if I was alone, but I was not!\n\nMaybe other rooms are better and we just got unlucky?",

      "text": "Hackan hotel is a very lovely hotel to stay if you want to be near the ADB airport (approximately 25TL from/to the airport via taxi). The hotel staffs are lovely and helpful. When I and my friend first got to the hotel I had a problem with my sim card and they were kind enough to contact the call center for us. On the second time we stayed there (2 nights after checking out), they changed the room for us as we mistakenly booked a double bed and they knew we wanted it to be like the first time in which we booked 2 single beds. The room is nice and clean, so as breakfast. The hotel is also close to supermarket, restaurants, and cafes, very convenient for both business and leisure.",

Overlooked the main road but window soundproofing was good. Shower strong and hot. Staff got me emergency toothpaste. Very nice breakfast and a complimentary late check out because my car wasn't ready. Lovely stay - thank you Hakcan Hotel",
