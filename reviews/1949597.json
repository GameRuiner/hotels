      "text": "Let me start by saying I'll probably get a copy and paste response - \"we will feedback to the relevant departments\".\n\nI hate writing bad reviews but anyone booking I want you to be aware.\n\n1. They sell day passes to outside guests which means they use the facilities for free but have a minimum food and drink spend. They kept selling these passes even when the hotel was full, resulting in no sunbeds and poor service for hotel guests. Felt like I was in Benidorm waking up at 7am to secure a sunbed. When I spoke to three managers about it, I was told they are not selling day passes because the hotel was full (the guests around the hotel told me differently), I went on the Jumeriah website and guess what I booked day passes. The Fairmont stopped day passes due to being full and the only place you could book them was here, so they ended up with double the number of day visitors. \n\n2. Service by the pool is bad. Order your food 45mins before you want it. The call button is either not working or the staff just ignore. My wife is vegan and was given a meat spaghetti.\n\n3. In the room you would need to call two or three times for the same request before it got done.\n\n4. There is a blame the guest culture here. \"You should've asked before you arrived\" is what I got told when I arrived to one bed to sleep three children.\n\n5. There is a lying culture here - \"we did not promise to move your room, we told you we would try our best\" - I have a WhatsApp message that proves what was said. The lying continued \"no we are not selling day passes\" - proof i have an email with a day pass booking.\n\n6. Check in - long queues. No nice welcome after being on a 7 hour flight with 4 kids. It was just painful.\n\n7. Overall they have very poorly trained staff. The service is just poor. The woman at the fruit counter at breakfast - particularly poor attitude. Chopping that watermelon after ignoring you five times doesn't leave you overall happy. \n\nNow I must add after constantly complaining they gave us credit on the room, but that's not what i want! £250 hotel credit when I've spent £12k on a holiday is not ok. I would like what i paid for, not a freebie.\n\nPriya at breakfast was fantastic! The restaurants including Amala was fantastic. Rooms are clean and well stocked. Kids club was fab! \n\nOverall not a 5 star. the hotel lets down the Jumeirah group big time!!! The leadership and management are to blame. Chloe Greenwood – no where to be seen & the management block you from speaking to her",

      "text": "So, this is without a doubt a lovely hotel, stunning rooms, great public area, good beach, great restaurants,  BUT it has become mind bogglingly  expensive.  Despite being half board and only one of us having mid day meals we averaged £200 a day on a couple of drinks with dinner and perhaps one during the day.  For example a bottle of water with your meal equates to £13.50, and it manages three glasses - that’s £4.50 a glass and that has to be a world record.  Also, as the week went on and the hotel became full there were no sunbeds to be had - just frustrated people on the beach wanting to sit down.  So when full elements of the hotel creak.  \n\nWe’ve been to this hotel several times but I think it’s been found poorly wanting this time round.",

A rich variety of dishes was available at any time of day or night, satisfying even the most discerning tastes.\n\nA distinctive feature of this hotel is its superb service. The attentive staff was ready to offer assistance with any inquiries and meet all guests' needs. I especially want to mention the professionalism and friendliness of the reception manager and staff, who were always ready to help and make my stay at the hotel as comfortable as possible. I particularly appreciated the receptionist, Jack, who was always ready to assist if needed, as well as Manager Antuan. In general, a cohesive and professional team deserves respect!\n\nThe hotel boasts the best spa in the world, where I was able to enjoy a variety of procedures and services aimed at my well-being and relaxation.\n\nMy stay at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray not only offered a luxurious interior but also stunning views of the city skyline and the famous Palm Jumeirah.

I frequent the hotel for pool and beach days regularly but hadn't stayed at the hotel.  It didn't disappoint.  Jumeirah group have the most exceptional service and the staff definitely make the experience special. \nWe had unlimited use of Talise spa which is my favourite spa day in Dubai.  \nThe club lounge experience was fabulous, the best Cosmopolitans I've had in Dubai in 12 years, the barman was superb.  The team in the lounge headed up by the super head of F&B who has worked for the Jumeirah group for many years, thoughtfully organised flowers for my sisters 50th as a surprise.  The team couldn't do enough, they were so lovely and made her feel very special. We went to Kyato restuartant one night which was gorgeous albeit they rushed a bit.  Rockfish another night, which was lovely food but the team are definitely rushed off their feet.  The team were so lovely to organise a buggy to take us to the Burg Al Arab for cocktails after dinner and then the team at the Burj organised for a buggy to take us onwards to a late night bar Black Tiger which is an undiscovered gem!  The whole experience was one to remember.  Thank you Jumeirah group",
