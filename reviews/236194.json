The Staff is always knowledgeable and helpful, the bed this time around was quite horrible which surprised me because 2 weeks prior the bed i had in the same hotel was sufficient that it did not leave such a memory as the terrible bed i had the second stay. The entire reason I decided to come back and stay was for the breakfast at this hotel, it is an amazing breakfast for an amazing price, i recommend 5 people that were staying in the hotel that they should not miss eating breakfast there.",

      "text": "The room assigned did not correspond to the photographs published on the hotel's website, where I actually made the reservation.  Small room, broken wall and floor covering, damaged furniture, miserable mattress and pillows.  Bathroom is tiny to the point where the door doesn't open completely, hitting the toilet!  \"Window\" communicating with the bathroom in the next room!  Never seen before!\n3 night stay in which we were placed in a room on the second floor, in front of the stairs. During th stay, a group of teenagers on a school trip stayed.  3 nights of hearing screams and confusion in the hallways at night.  The sound insulation is so bad that it felt like we were sleeping with the door open!\nWe complained to reception and they told us that the rooms were standard and that the night receptionist did not hear any noise.  We asked to be placed in a more isolated room away from the group and nothing was done.  Zero availability to provide us with a good experience and stay.  The least they should have done was consider accommodating a couple for 3 nights away from a group of teenagers from the beginning.\nHotel undergoing renovations but it had no impact on our stay. Very good breakfast for a 3 star hotel.  Positive point!\nUnfortunately the only one.  Not to be repeated!",
