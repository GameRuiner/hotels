The walls are very thin so you can hear people from other rooms if they are talking loudly or even flushing the toilet!!! The room was clean with nice views. The shower was very small and stunk of sewage! The location is very good, close to metro stations and the beautiful kordonay bay. It's on a main road so we did find it hard to sleep the first night then swapped to a different room where the noise was less. The receptionists were quite helpful. They have a lift service which is great! I would stay here again as long as the room is on the back side and the shower doesn't smell! There is no good option otherwise I would have given it that!!",
