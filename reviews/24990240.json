      "text": "Truly an unforgettable experience. We loved it here. \n\nWe came to celebrate our joint 30th birthday and they had decorated the room for us which was lovely. The room is massive and we didn’t upgrade. Amazing shower and very comfortable bed. So much room as someone who likes to unpack everything and make myself at home. \n\nThe TV has maybe one English Channel and no way of casting from an Apple device, only Samsung. You can cast music though which worked for us. \n\nThe staff here are second to none. They are so friendly and accommodating and really made the stay special.\n\nThe front lobby is grand and luxurious with tall ceilings and beautiful furniture. The bar is great and the little snacks available all day and night are good for late night snacks after a day of drinking by the pool. \n\nMy only complaint about the front lobby bar is that they allow smoking. Inside and outside and it is really off-putting to non-smokers which was a shame as the terrace is a real sun trap. \n\nThere is an Indian fusion restaurant upstairs which was nice as well as their special” restaurant which you must book. The food was good but I wouldn’t worry if you can’t get a table the food in the other restaurants are just as good. \n\nSpeaking of, there is the main buffet on the ground floor for breakfast and lunch, which is better than most all inclusive and also for dinner but it is the upstairs restaurant which pips them all for me for dinner. The Middle Eastern inspired dishes in large tagines were to die for. \n\nThe cocktails are so so strong, even as a Brit, they knocked me sideways. The entertainment was good but so loud no matter which room you were in up until about 11:30pm. The beach is very nice but the weather was a bit too windy for us in January to sit there all day. \n\nThat’s the only downside of this hotel. It is built as the perfect wind tunnel coming off the ocean and it is very windy and brisk all day long even in the midday heat. A small breeze is welcome but it was so windy it would knock drinks over and make it too cold to lounge for long. This could easily be mitigated by installing so wind breakers and the stay would be perfect. \n\nWe would definitely come back. It was worth every penny.",

      "text": "What a fantastic two-week relaxing holiday! First time in Egypt for me and my partner and we would certainly visit this hotel. All the staff are very hard working, all areas are immaculate and are always being cleaned, no rubbish, no rowdy people, lovely food, and drink.\n\nAirport upon arrival it was not as bad as expected but you must fill in a landing form so make sure you take a pen and fill it in before you go to the VISA counter or they will abruptly send you away (you must do this upon returning also). Upon return you do get checked and searched several times; you just get on with it. \n\nThe hotel; I had emailed prior to arrival and asked for the \"sunny side\" high floor, we were given room 2504 which was spot on for everything. I asked for additional coat hangers and they arrived 10 minutes later. Mid-week I filled a survey saying that you could do with a stool in the bathroom for me when drying hair, when I got back to the room there was one there. If you need anything just ask.\n\nRoom; Mahmood kept the room immaculate for the full fortnight, the fridge was topped up with water, tea/coffee/sugar, two beers, big bottle of lemonade and coke and two small cartons of orange. Fresh fluffy towels every day.  The room has plenty of storage and is very spacious which overlooked the spa end pool of lobby of the hotel. you want milk for the room, ask and they will give you a litre carton of milk. The bed was very comfortable.\n\nPool and beach; Waiters went around all day serving drinks you just must know your table number if you are on the beach. You are offered fruit daily in all areas.  \n\nThere are two ends of the pool, the first one is near to the spar which is heated and quite popular, you did have to get a bed by 07:30 although if you arrived later if there was space the pool attendants would more than happy get you a bed. This area was very peaceful and no music apart from the aqua aerobics around lunch time. The barmen were fantastic especially Samoul who supplies you with drinks all day long and he is such a fun character (loved him to bits and he came to say bye when we left and I had a tear in my eye). El Seyed also kept us supplied with drinks.\n\nThe pools at the beach end and in the middle were cold water hence why we mainly stayed at the spa end.   The beach end is mainly where the daily entertainment was.\nThe beach was always very busy so we did not use it as it looked a bit cramped and I was informed you had to be down very early as people were reserving the beds.  \n\nFood; we went in all the restaurants and could not fault the food one bit. Service was spot on, always a table and waiters provided you with drinks straight away and your plates were cleared very quickly. Always a good choice of meat, fish, pasta, salads. We had omelettes every morning which were amazing, you order what ingredients you like. Surprisingly although it was very hot, we had a lot of soup as they were so tasty. \n\nDrinks; basically, you can have what you like, it is bottled beer, nice wine, bottled coke, sprite, Fanta orange and gorgeous cocktails. We went every night for pre-drinks to the lobby bar where the service was impeccable and a big shout to Ahmed Mahmoud who was our top man, Hershram and Khaled who were always smiling even though they do long shifts and none stop working. \n\nEntertainment - not sure why but during our two weeks stay the entertainments team changed, the first ones were fun and outgoing and really got involved with the holiday makers. The second team (current ones), although the manager is very enthusiastic some of his staff do not appear to have a clue what they are doing, it could be they are new to this type of work but they were not as friendly as the first entertainment group. There is a club on site but this didn't open until after 11pm and most people went to bed by then. Sometimes it was just a couple of people in there. \n\nBoat trip booked at the hotel beach - we went on the day one, 0930 to 3pm for 55 Euros each. You are taken to an area for snorkelling, we felt this was quite rushed, although you had 45 minutes you all had to stay together in a group, some were quicker than others and we struggled to keep up with the pace of the group in the water although we did see some fantastic fish. There was a further stop for snorkelling, we did not get off the boat as the first one was too tiring. We then went to orange Bay, after about 45 minutes it became quite boring and most of the people were sat on bean bags under cover for the next hour due to the heat. The bonus was we saw some dolphins. You were provided with \"soft\" drinks and lunch on the boat, a \"supermarket\" boat did offer additional drinks, snacks at an extra charge. All in all, it was a decent trip but would do a private one if we did it again and not stay at Orange Bay for so long. \n\nLike we said all of the staff are amazing but certain ones were fantastic; pool waiters and lobby waiters. Don't hesitate if your not happy with anything.",
