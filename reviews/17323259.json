      "text": "We stayed here for 6 nights April 2024. We had a balcony room with half board (Breakfast and Lunch/Dinner). EVERYTHING about this hotel was great. The rooms are large and clean. The staff is friendly. Thank you Anas! It's in a great location - Metro station across the street ...5 minute walk to Marina....Careem bike station right outside hotel....Supermarket and Liquor store right next door....Beach 10 minute walk ...and the food for Breakfast and Dinner (buffet) was WONDERFUL. Also free parking for those who are crazy enough to drive in Dubai. Highly recommend!",

By the time it came I didnt want it. \nThe gym at this hotel is very limited for equipment . \nIf you have a late at night departure flight and you have to check out of your room there’s NO SHOWERS FOR YOU TO USE ( I’ve  stayed in a 2 star hotel in magluf and they even  had showers ) also our luggage was put down some corridor where anyone could of got hold of it .\n\nI’ve stayed in many hotel all over Dubai and this honestly has to be the worst. Definitely isn’t a 4 star but lovely rooms",
