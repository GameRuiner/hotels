      "text": "We are regular visitors to Baron hotels, 7 times in the Baron Palace and twice in the Baron Resort. Every time we visit from the moment we arrive to the moment we leave we have never been disappointed.\n\nWe traveled to the Baron Resort on the 20th March for the first time in 10 years due to going to the Baron Palace in Hurghada. On arrival we checked in quickly with the same welcome and attentive staff. When in our room straight away we noticed twin beds and a room that was a bit tired. After mentioning this it was quickly rectified and we were given a room upgrade. Whilst we were initially disappointed, this was dealt with swiftly. I must mention the F+B manager Mohamed Hassan for his understanding and speedy resolution. He was available around the hotel for the duration of our holiday and engaged with us daily he felt more like a General  Manager  rather than food and beverage Manager. For us by far the best restaurant was the pool side bar the team there were attentive and nothing was too much trouble. Food was always fresh, hot and enjoyable. Positives, certainly are the staff could not fault any one from the Management to the Gardeners all worthy of 5 stars. Great value for money in comparison to Baron Palace. \nOver all an enjoyable stay but could benefit from a bit of an upgrade/ refurbishment in comparison to the Baron Palace however the Resort is far more reasonably priced.",
