      "text": "This was our 8th stay at Regency Plaza Aqua Park and yet again it exceeded all our expectations. The hotel has extensive well kept landscape gardens, several clean pools, large beach with comfortable sunbeds and several restaurants. Our seaview room was large, well cleaned with tea/coffee making facilities and daily bottles of water.\n\nWe were treated like royalty from arrival to departure. Outstanding and professional service from Hossam at front office and many laughs with Mustafa and Ayman (FO).  Food in the buffet restaurants has massively improved, thank you to Chef Mohamed Moustafa for seeing to all our needs. \nF&B staff from waiters to managers very efficient and hard working especially the bar waiters on the terrace on an evening. Baher in royal restaurant very polite and solves any problems. Staff went above and beyond to ensure we had another memorable stay.\n\nHave seen many positive improvements the last few years and extremely pleased to see the Ivory buffet restaurant open again.\n\nWe look forward to our next visit from Nicky, Viv and Frank",

The staff are amazing and looked after you like family. They couldn't do enough for you, were kind courteous & helpful. The hotel itself is set in beautiful gardens that are kept immaculate. The pools are clean & refreshing. The beach is easily accessible, with a pier to walk to snorkelling in the amazing Red Sea. The rooms are spacious, clean & comfortable. The food selection is more than generous, with several restaurants, pizzarias & snack bars to chose from. The staff are the jewel in the crown. Thank you all for making our stay amazing.

      "text": "We stayed at the Regency Plaza for a week. It’s a great value for money, but more of a 3 star hotel in my opinion. \n\nFew people that deserve a mention - Baseem, who runs the pizza pasta restaurant, Himda, our waiter in the main restaurant, provided exceptional service with a friendly smile, making every meal a pleasure. And Tehe, the lifeguard at the kids' pool, very friendly guy.\nAlso special mention to Fabi, the barman from pool bar - great cocktails!\n\nThe hotel is generally clean, looked after and everyone is very polite. Food in the buffet restaurant is okay, can get a bit boring but there are plenty of choices a short walk from the hotel - Arab Bucks was our favourite.\n\nI would advise not to buy anything from the guests jewellery shop. The prices are way too high, much better choice at the Soho square and reasonable prices. Luckily we didn’t buy anything from the hotel shop, but the price difference was quite significant on the same watch…! \n\nOur overall stay at Regency Plaza was really pleasant, thanks to the outstanding staff and amenities.",
