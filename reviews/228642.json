Even though the staff was nice the main problem with the hotels was consistency in service. \n\nDue to the lack of communication between the staff between day and night pass, and the fact that no one informed me, i was forced to go down to the reception the last night to clear out a payment error for the extended night. \n\nMy booking was made early in November but due to a change in my flight schedule I extended my visit with one night. This was done in late november, and was confirmed both by the hotels own booking system and by the reception. \n\nWhe I checked in they failed to inform me that the extended night needed to be paid separately when I asked to pay for the stay at the check-in. Sub-par customer care.\n\nOtherwise:\n+ Good location\n+ Nice staff in general\n\n- Minibar not restocked\n- Cleaning missed several items\n- The executive Terrace room was really small, and not worth the extra cost",
