      "text": "First of all, we loved this hotel. The staff was great and the rooms were lovely.  However....we were robbed in the lobby restaurant during the day at a corner table.   We had checked in the day before and had dinner at the SAME table.  Our kids had flown in the second morning and had rested in our room since their rooms were not available.  In the early afternoon the adults came down and we were playing cards.  A female employee brought us chips without us asking.  Later she brought olives. Again without a request for them.  I recognized her as the hostess from the upstairs restaurant where we had lunch that day.   A man wearing a Michigan shirt came and sat directly next to my daughter.  There wasn't another person in the restaurant.  I said \"GO BLUE\".  He just looked at me.  I repeated myself and my son in law said in Spanish, \"your t-shirt\" and pointed to his shirt.  Coincidence that he walked in off the street?  Perhaps... I looked up to see him walking away rapidly and my son in law realized that his phone and wallet that he had sat on the shelf behind my daughter were gone.  In Spain you must report your crime and then the police look at the security video.  We went to report and the police said we don't speak English...they couldn't have cared less. The hotel wouldn't allow us to view the security tapes.  A very unhappy start to our vacation.",

It's an absolute bummer that the birthday card for your mom's special day slipped through the cracks - we aim to make every celebration unforgettable, and it´s a shame that it didn´t reach her room, as the do not disturb sign was on and therefore we couldn´t enter her room and leave the note and cava we had for her to celebrate. On a brighter note, our team is always eager to share the local gems and festivities that make Barcelona buzz with energy. We're delighted you're soaking up the culture and hope you'll continue to discover all the delightful surprises our city has in store. Stay Curious!\n\nWe hope to welcome you back.\nBest wishes,\n\nBelén Sánchez, Guest Relations Manager",

Would like to thank Jorge at the front desk and Gabriel at the luggage station for going above and beyond to make our stay comfortable! Other amazing feature is free mini bar with local beverages, yoga mat, plenty of power sockets, incl USB and wireless. Breakfast buffet also very good, variety of foods  incl. gluten free and vegan. Welcoming and helpful staff at the buffet. Last but not least, the housekeeping keep the rooms very clean and are very helpful! Also, right in front of the hotel is the metro station which you can use to go around in Barcelona. Highly recommend this hotel! \nMariya, Angel and Nia",

Thanks for the rave review.\n\nWe're absolutely thrilled that you found our location fantastic and that our staff made such a memorable impression during your stay. It's wonderful to hear that you'd recommend us to friends and family—nothing beats word of mouth! We take pride in being nestled in the heart of Barcelona's cultural epicenter, a stone's throw from the vibrant Las Ramblas and the refreshing sea breeze of the beaches. It's music to our ears that you've experienced the artful embrace of our city, and that our hotel served as your urban retreat.\nWhile we're all about smooth landings and takeoffs, we're glad to hear that the taxi fare from the airport didn't take the shine off your journey. Remember, our team is always on hand to share the secret local spots so you can dive deeper into the Barcelona vibe next time you visit.\n\nSee you again soon.\nTake care,\n\nBelén Sánchez, Guest Relations Manager",
