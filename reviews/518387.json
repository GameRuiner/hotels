All first floor updated and modernised. Meals  are delicious, which is big plus. Also hotel is full with airline personnel and Pilots :) \nVery nice and relaxing pool! \nOnly improvement can be, SPA personnel has desk just before door to outside pool and every time you go in and out she asks whether we need spa service. \nTurkish tea you get usually is not good but it is like in your house in this hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel it is well worth the money you pay!",
