The bar staff and animation team are exceptional and such genuine people. Momo gave us ultimate speed boat trip for snorkelling and dolphin watching.

I praise everyone, but especially these: SALAH üòÅ lifeguard - for supervision and sense of humor (Titanic song üòÅ) Ibrahim ‚ù§Ô∏è waiter - thank you for your work, smile and good fun all in one.  Thank you Ayman for your interest.  Bartenders ‚ù§Ô∏è especially Ramy, two Ahmed (lower pool and Zin Zina bar), Rahim (beach). I would like to thank my ‚ù§Ô∏èEgyptian masseuse‚ù§Ô∏è who is a professional and massages with her whole body (literally üòç).  And to everyone else I met but didn't remember their names.  You are the best, thanks to you it was a great holiday and I want to come back to you.  Mr. hotel president, they deserve a salary increase üíØüëå\n\nüå∏üòçüê†A huge advantage of the resort is that there is no hotel nearby on one side, so you can sail far along the reef.\nWhen it comes to food, there is a large selection, but breakfast and lunch were the same throughout the week.  It's a bit boring but overall tasty.\n\nThe facility is very nice, well-kept, clean, not the newest, so it requires renovation in many places, but something is being renewed all the time.  Before our arrival there was a swimming pool, and during our arrival there were two lobby rooms which have been renoverd.\n\nI think this is the most important information ‚ù§Ô∏è Greetings Sonia ü•∞",
