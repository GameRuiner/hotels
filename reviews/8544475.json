      "text": "Day 2 both me and my wife spent the rest of the holday (7 nights) desperately ill with food poisoning still suffering when we got home. Clearly there is a serious issue with food hygiene here or good practice within 12hrs of eating at the Bam Bam restaurant the holiday was ruined spent over £70 at the pharmacy nothing they prescribed could cure it. Tried starving ourselves nothing worked. \nAnother issue everyday day around 17 the whole area was covered in thick toxic smoke that smelled like burning plastic or rubber. Literally took your breath away no idea what it was. \nThe wifi only exists near the bars and is very poor hard to believe in this day and age there was no wifi in the room and we had the royal suite. \nThe sattelite tv only had 1 channel BBC world new with on the loop news. \nThe place is run down and needs money spending on it empty fish tanks the ones with water in were full of green Algea.\nThe chefs use the loos in full dress hats the lot. \nGood points staff were particularly friendly more so with tip. You cant get to the beach without over persistant blokes trying to sell you the spa or a facial treatment drives you bonkers.\nSumming up if you want to risk nearly dying from food poisoning or are desperate to lose weigh then this is the place to be. \nNever again for us it was a disaster.",
