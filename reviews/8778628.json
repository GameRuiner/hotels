      "text": "This hotel is well located at the edge of the Gothic quarter, and close to Plaza, Catalunya, and exaimple district. so walking to other areas is quite possible. There are also metro stops close by. It is on via Laietana which leads down to Barceloneta, about a 10 to 15 minute walk. The hotel is quite modern and the rooms are well equipped. The bathrooms are modern with stall rain showers. Our room had a balcony on the seventh floor. There is a nice rooftop patio and bar area with a small pool. This is a nice area to have a drink and relax after a long day and prior to dinner. We did not eat in the restaurant there. The breakfast is excellent and huge can order Ã  la cart orders and there is a buffet and you can order espresso drinks.\nThe staff of very helpful and friendly. The hotel does not have a gym.\n\nThis is an excellent hotel had a good price point close to many sites",
