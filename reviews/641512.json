      "text": "You will regret your stay. Please do not stay there. We paid in advance for 7 days. I traveled with my husband. The hotel is very very very dirty. We were given blood stained bed sheet when we didn't get our room cleaned and asked for a clean bed sheet to change it ourselves. I couldn't believe my eyes ! When I talked to the manager, he didn't care. It looked like he was used to the complaints....the room is dark, smelly, with cockroches etc etc...There is no refund if you want to leave and the price is not cheap. In Jan we paid about 95 per night...There are much much better places to stay.....",

      "text": "Honestly after reading few reviews recently i was a bit worried, to my surprise during the stay Landmark Team has improved quite alot and it might just be that some guests expect too much, if you want 5star service or standard you should b willing to pay for same!  A hotel is open 24/7 and we should expect continuous maintenance works being done and for that staffs cannot be blamed as they try their very best. Landmark is a great spot, in the centre and close to everything... short or long stay, this Hotel is affordable with Staff whose always trying and willing to help! From the bell boy, security staff, night manager (nice guy n always smiling), Safash, Afifi, Suraj and Priya, good job! They try their best to handle every request and they even show empathy! Keep up the good work, we had the chance to meet the HM who is also a great guy! Will definitely b back soon...",
