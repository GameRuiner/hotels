      "text": "My stay at the Hotel was generally very pleasant. My double room was large, comfortable but rather gloomy and basic. No view whatsoever though, just looking out on a brick wall with some sort of canvas between the windows and brick wall covered in bird droppings so the blinds are always pulled down. Bathroom was careworn but for 3 star hotel just about ok. Breakfast was fine enough and staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. Some staff members at reception had much better English than others but perhaps I should learn some Turkish. Special call out to Hatice, very lovely lady who arranged everything for me when booking the appointment for the FES Spa Hamman where I got the 'full treatment' and directions to places I wanted to go. One of the cheapest 3 star hotels in Izmir.",

We checked out yesterday and will be back again. \n\nWalking through the lobby, I was immediately struck by the warmth and kindness of the owner and staff. The hotel staff was extremely kind, professional, attentive, friendly and helpful and multi lingual. The rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped with everything you would need for a comfortable stay. The hotel has its Hamam (Turkish bath), swimming pool and spa. Here for business? 2 very large, well equipped conference rooms are available for your business needs. \n\nWhat makes this hotel truly stand out to me is the location. Itâ€™s smack dab in the middle of everything. Walking distance to the famous Knok Bazaar and surrounded by every store imaginable. The best shops, restaurants, Baklava stores and more. \n\n5 minute walk to the beautifully stunning harbor where you can spend the day strolling or taking a boat ride to take in the  sea",
