Rizal cleaned our room today and left us a bath with rose petals which was amazing. It was my husbands 50th the hotel put a cake in our room amd spelt happy birthday on the bed wirh petals. Faith, Cristy & Mohan in the bar were the friendliest, loveliest bar staff ever and arranged a happy birthday singsong and cake in the bar. The Italian did the same. The guys around the beach also cannot do enough for you. Michael Khalifa couldn't do enough for us thank you for making this a fantastic stay!",

We loved Sarah at the patisserie because of her amazing personality she is a kind caring lady.\n\nI loved the fact that we could get tickets to the Atlantis water park it was a quick journey there and it was an awesome experience \n\nAt the rixos we all enjoy javed because he is fun and friendly. This being our 5th visit we feel like we know him now.\n\nWe enjoyed all the restaurants in the evening and for breakfast and lunch we really liked turquoise as it was quiet and relaxed.\n\nIt was a pleasure to stay at the rixos it was a great atmosphere.  We hope to see you again soon",
