      "text": "Let me start with the negative feedback first;\nI don't know what they wanted to ensure, but they asked for a card to ensure entry. I asked when I was leaving, card information was automatically deleted. There were already 2 small drinks in the minibar so there was nothing to guarantee. The modern and innovative architecture in the lobby is not reflected in the rooms. The rooms are more like a hostel. The room I stayed in was old, the air conditioning button looked like it would be left in my hand. I told the receptionist and they fixed it during the day. I couldn't figure out the smell in the room. There is a huge fan/propeller in the room that I cannot understand. They were no water in the room. There were granular coffees that dissolved in water, but the milk was in small cans! \nIt's a spa hotel but I didn't see any bathrobes or slippers.\n\nMy positive feedback\nApproximately 10 minutes walking distance from Collblanc metro station. You have the privilege of passing by Barcelona Nou Camp stadium on your way to the metro. You may get an omelet for the breakfast. Cheese and fruit varieties were rich. Breakfast was generally enjoyable with dairy products, jams, and coffee varieties. I don't know how the breakfast buffet of a 4-star hotel in a destination boasting of its olives could not have olives.\nThere is a fixed iron in the room which is not very easy to use. First, you need to press the iron icon and then press the on/off button. Basic bathroom accessories are available. No slippers. I have no comment as I did not use the spa or pool.\nI don't know if I will come again, but I can recommend it in terms of price / benefit.",

The rooms were not cleaned properly. Towels, toiletries, water were missing, and we had to call the reception often. Very poor cleaning of rooms. The breakfast was fine; however, one of the mangers behaved very unethically.  My sister and her husband usually have a coffee/juice prior to walking and then have breakfast. One of the mangers told them it is not allowed since it is considered to eat twice; that was the first time experiencing that. They travel a lot and have no such an issue around the world. However, the manger on duty yelled at them and behaved in such unprofessional manner. The only good thing about this hotel is the location near the water, metro is not far; however, its far from the center and not in a modern area of Barcelona.",
