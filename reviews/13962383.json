The view on the sagrada familia is a lie. You see the peak of the towers. That's not a view. We asked some tips at the receptions and the first girl didn't understand what I was saying and the second receptionist sent us to a place that was closed for private event for a week. No concierge service. Very bad value for money",

      "text": "No wonder this place has won a Traveller’s Choice award!\n\nFrom the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel extremely welcome. Jesus checked us in and was informative, helpful and superbly professional.  We had arrived early and he accommodated us with early check in - nothing was too much trouble.\n\nRoom was lovely and spacious with well designed hanging space. Excellent amenities and facilities.\n\nPool was too chilly for us (March weather) but a nice area to sit and relax none the less.\n\nGym was a sanctuary space open all hours, so gave much more flexibility to the visit. The cardio equipment is older Technogym spec, but well maintained. My only (and small gripe) was that there is only 1 combo weight machine and the free weights only went up to 14kg.  But still, a great space to use during the vacation.\n\nOriginally we hadn’t booked breakfast, but we added it in - SO GLAD WE DID! Best meals of the trip were the breakfasts at the hotel! Sumptuous selections of hot and cold foods as well as chef prepared area and amazing pastries. \n\nOur return flight was late in the evening, so upon checkout, they graciously extended the stay and then we paid a bit extra for a further extension.  After that, the team still allowed us to store our bags and use the upper deck/pool area - which we did for a bit, but then made our way to the bar for some stylish drinks before heading off.  \n\nA truly lovely stay, incredible hospitality from every member of staff.\n\nIf we ever came back to Barcelona, we wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",
