      "text": "Overall the holiday in Stella di Mare was really amazing! We were very lucky to be welcomed by Mena Aziz at the reception and this was the most kind, professional, warm and friendly welcome, which we ever had (we travel 4-5 times a year) and we appreciated it very much.  A separate thanks goes to lobby bar (Mohamed (the manager), Mohamed, Mario and Maher. The food and drinks are of exceptional quality (every dinner was dedicated to some region and the food was very delicious with a lot of options to choose from), comparing with other hotels in Egypt it is outstanding. Every time it was difficult to choose what to eat, as the variety was so rich. Most of staff really try to do everything and more to make you happy and enjoy your holiday, however Fahmy from the reception made us feel unwelcomed with our inquiry, so that a little bit overclouded our stay. However overall experience was great and we will definatelly come back to this hotel! We hope very much to be welcomed by Mena Aziz when we come back our next time!",

The service is outstanding and they cant do enough for you. The food is lovely, fresh, hot and plentiful. They have barbecues, fresh stations for pizza, meat, eggs and pasta, more salad and cake options that anyone could need and huge hot buffet trays with food that was actually kept hot. We had treatmemts in the spa which were professional and very well priced. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and would return",

Staying there brings back memories of the great sevice we used to get in those hotels. the Staff is exceptional , friendly and capable , they all have been with the hotel for years and know every trick to get you what you want or need, be it laundry service , a technician, a doctor, expresso or capucino. Never been in a hotel where so many guests were people who had been coming there for years and years (15-16- 17 visits, unbelievable).\nRomany was the best pool attendant ever,  Taleb &Mohamed took care of our drinks. The crew at the restaurants became like family. The room and hallways were kept spotless. Reception treated me like a king , nothing was impossible and delivered pronto. My wife needed medical attention , the docter showed up soon after our call and provided expert very friendly medical care until midnight when necessary.\nwe took them up on their 'romantic dinner by the sea' offer, a never to forget experience. The 'Desert Rose Diving' centre is living up to the standards set by the hotel\nthank you, stella di Mare",
