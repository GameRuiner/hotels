I understand the fabric of the building is ancient but  the sound proofing is appalling and unfortunately we had spectacularly noisy and inconsiderate guests in the next room. 3 nights of solid partying from 3am and a strong smell of dope elicited  no useful response from reception. “ Phone down and we will ask them to be quiet” which appeared to have no impact whatsoever\nThe last morning of our stay all the other guests on the “ principal floor” were at reception with identical concerns. Despite reassurances the “ guests “ would be asked to leave as this was a “family hotel “ they were firmly ensconced on our departure. No manager was available in the hotel to escalate concerns to. Don’t stay here and avoid H10 - they are swift to charge your credit card but trying to get a refund of any description is like crossing the rubicon …the hotel staff claim they don’t have authority to do anything apart from offer you an e mail address for accounts. \nIf you are unlucky enough to have booked -don’t pay for breakfast. Hopeless coffee machine and the same plate of mouldy grapes appeared on 3 consecutive days….",
