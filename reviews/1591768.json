All the Al La Carte restaurants were first class and equal to UK standards. Staff worthy of note are Ahmed in the main restaurant who made each meal special. Melad at the lower pool who's service with drinks was never ending, and last but not least is Hany in the main lounge and reception area whos's Chocolate Martinis were very special and served with witty remarks and a genuine smile. We will definitely stay here again. Keep up the good work.",

      "text": "What an amazing hotel. We arrived at 10:30pm and was told that food was on for us. We expected something like sandwiches but was amazed that the food was fresh and there was a great choice (I had Veal). The rooms are huge and very clean and looked after. We stayed on the ground floor rm 1122. My wife and I have been to Hurghada 6 time before but had not stayed in this hotel. The sun bed are plenty full and are very comfortable. There is a fantastic salt pool next to the beech which we used on the first day but preferred the beech so stayed there for the rest of the week. The staff are brilliant. Karam (lifeguard) helped every morning set up the sun bed and then cleaned our sunglasses, then Mohammad. Nouby made sure we didn’t need to go to the bar once during the day. Just brilliant.\nThe food is great too. We had breakfast in the main restaurant where there is plenty of  choice and then had lunch in the Ossiamo restaurant. This is ordered off the menu or a buffet is again in the main restaurant.\nThe entertainment is down by the pool bar which is the usual Egyptian entertainment (it’s ok).\nOver all, a brilliant hotel and a brilliant holiday. The staff can’t do enough for you. Thank you for making our stay special.",

      "text": "As creatures of habit we returned to Le Reve for a 14 night stay in a junior suite with VIP package at the beginning of March. At this hotel we know we will get first class service with a smile from everyone at all times. It is one of the most relaxing hotels we have visited and remains a firm favourite when we need to escape cold, dull UK for some warmth and sunshine. \nOur room was spotless and immaculately serviced by Mahmoud with numerous examples of towel sculptures to raise a smile after a hard day relaxing by the pool and having your sunglasses cleaned, fruit salad and drinks served and umbrellas moved all without leaving the sunbed. The pool team are all superstars.\nRestaurants were as superb as ever with a great selection available in the buffet for breakfast and lunch. We only ate dinner in the buffet on the night we arrived as the VIP package gives access to all the a la carte restaurants which are superb. Bear in mind that all menus are to some extent an Egyptian take on the speciality cuisine and dishes might not be quite what you get in UK. This adds to the charm. \nThe VIP package also gives access to the Executive Club lounge which is great for pre dinner drinks and is an excellent place to meet and chat with other guests. We have made many friends in the Exec and as there are a large number of “returners” we always meet and renew friendships and catch up on each others’ news, and exchange details of other holiday destinations. The Exec club is the only bar that serves sparkling wine.\nThis year the hotel has finally completed an upgrade of the WiFi and coverage in our room was excellent and poolside was good early morning before it got busy as lack of bandwidth limits connectivity when the area gets busy. It is now more than adequate for keeping touch by email and downloading the daily newspaper puzzles page\nSunday lunch was served as a barbecue by the poolside bar and restaurant. When we stayed it had only been done three or four times and teething problems were being ironed out. Quality of the fare was excellent but the windy weather made keeping food hot between grill and plate a challenge for the team We look forward to seeing how service works when we return in the autumn.\nThe grounds are beautifully maintained and the gardening team work hard to keep all areas trimmed and mowed. Note that “fogging” is carried out most evenings to ensure that no biting insect population becomes a problem\nIf you want a break where you are thoroughly spoiled and want to chill out and relax where the only noise to upset tranquillity is the daily aqua aerobics class from 11:30 until 12:00 with an annoying “Ooh Ooh” chant on the count of 7 then you will enjoy the Le Reve. We schedule a walk from 11 through 12 .\nAll the staff are superb and always have a smile and a willingness to ensure your holiday is as good as it can be. All are superstars\nWe have already booked our next trips to ensure we do not miss out.",

      "text": "This was our first visit to the hotel. We were very impressed with all aspects of it. We were pleased with our room, which was very large and enjoyed watching the sunset from our balcony. The cleanliness of all areas was very impressive. Even the toilets around the swimming were immaculate and the cleaner needs to be recognised for his work. The swimming pools were probably the cleanest that I have swam in. The food is of a very high standard, with a wide variety  to meet everyones needs. The a la carte restaurants were very good, not only for the choice on the menu, but also in quantity that was served.The grounds are immaculate, with grass like a putting green. You are greeted on arrival, by staff who are so helpful and want to please and this continues throughout your stay. The reception area is something very special and when we arrived there was a violinist playing and other instrumentalists each evening. The beach and jetty are kept spotlessly clean and staff are always on hand both on the beach and around the pool, moving sunbeds and delivering drinks. There is a very pleasant walk to the marina, approx. 3kms. Golf buggy type vehicles are available to hire from the hotel. My wife, used the Spa and was very pleased with the treatments that she received.\nIn my opinion, the success of this hotel, is because of the Hotel Manager Mr. Fouqet Zakaria, who is around the whole hotel,restaurants and grounds throughout the day. He wants to speak to the guests, he wants to know that you are happy with everything. He also has other staff talking to guests, making sure they are happy as well. \nWe hope to return again in October this year.\nRichard & Jane Yandell",
