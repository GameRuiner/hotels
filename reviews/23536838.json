      "text": "We travelled to coral sea water world for one week as a last minute deal.\nReviews were promising.\nThe amount of security is great and safe and can understand but unfortunately it put us off and we didn‚Äôt feel relaxed.\nHotel is all inclusive the alcohol is vile, used to bring us flat beer we‚Äôd send it back and get the same glass backü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è wine was like plastic. the food wasn‚Äôt any better. The buffet was always beef or fish, or bbq. Kids area was terrible my son lived in chips or chips all week ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThere was never anything different always same food repeated or like warm half cooked pasta. Mosquitos tortured us even with everything to stop them! \nThe pools are nice and well staffed with life guards. Water slides good. \nThe alcohol and food was a major let down for us, and would stop us returning.\n\nLast 3 days of the holiday I was in bed ill with sickness & diarrhoea. TUI called to check on me but nothing could really be done, got home ended up on antibiotics, never been ill from going abroad and followed all the rules regarding tap water, ice , not touching there money.\n\nEntertainment wasn‚Äôt good always local dancers on a night speakers blasting  through the room ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm not a party pooper I love good entertainment but it hard when your in a hollow room with ott music booming. Entertainment staff never spoke to us once on evenings only daytime when trying to get us to do activities we said no thanks to , they still continually pushed.\n\nSpa is amazing and would recommend a massage or body scrub, even if I lost my last one due to being ill.\n\nDidn‚Äôt find the streets safe and felt uncomfortable being hounded by taxi drivers and shop keeps following us so stayed in the week. Really disappointing wouldn‚Äôt back or recommend, many of us said the same and on arrival at airport lots of us agreed never again.\nShame as it could be so much more.",

Amazing hotel! I am very happy and satisfied with the services. Very clean, organised, and spotless. All staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Mustafa at reception. The main reason we had a great time was what we did with the animation team there. We celebrated my daughter's birthday there, and the animation team made it unforgettable for us. We did very fun activities with the team every night. My 6-year-old daughter loved attending mini discos every night prompt at 8:30, thanks to Destiny. Destiny is one of the best in the animation team, and she is in charge of mini disco; she is so polite, friendly, and nice. My daughter already missed her. I definitely recommend this place to everyone and will visit again.",

They are sister hotels and all linked so you can use both.\nApparently our hotel is more for couples, we had a lovely beach. Beautiful rooms, food was phenomenal everywhere. There are six restaurants and seven poles for everybody to enjoy whether you like quiet, noisy, aerobics or have Children. We also went to the Waterworld which was a fab change, going on the lazy river and the flumes and slides a little bit of a giggle for 4 nearly 60-year-oldsüòÇ\nAround in about the hotel felt safe lots of shops, bars and restaurants. Also went on a boat trip that we arranged with Alex at the result. He tailored it to our needs so the four of us went out on a speedboat. Had a fabulous day you just need to ask everybody is so polite and helpful.\nNo hard sell spa and gym were brilliant.",

The toddler pool is extremely warm, and the pirate splash park was great for kids too! The larger rides are fab too, especially as our 6 year old could ride them all as he was over 120cm (which is the limit). The hotel is immaculate throughout, and the workers work soo hard to keep the place clean and tidy. We would defo re-visit! The lifeguards were fab and our 6 year old Teddy loved Mustafa especially! The pool guys made a lovely effort on my partners birthday and decorated the sun beds with balloons and decorations.. and gave him a birthday present too!",
