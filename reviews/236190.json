Temperature not adjustable and so hot middle of the night.\nThe hallways smelt of cigarettes even though its a non smoking hotel (the room did not smell).\nRoom cleaned and fresh towels,however bedsheets not changed in a week.\n\nOverall this hotel is a fantastic base and has what you need. A few tweaks is all it needs and wouldn't stop me booking again.",

Walkable to Sagrada Familia, couple of subway stops to ramblas and gothic quarter and great restaurants. Breakfast was not that great - simple fare.. some croissants and the like, some cereal and boiled egg, yoghurt and fruits. Cheese and spread was very basic/packaged.. ok for a business trip. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Restroom is small, but clean and no concerns. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Not much of a lobby :) ",
