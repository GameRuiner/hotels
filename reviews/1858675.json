      "text": "An excellent well-appointed resort with plentiful facilities, a large and comfortable bedroom and stand-out staff able to cater to our needs. Wonderful value considering the all-inclusivity of the catering, the multiple swimming pools and Jacuzzis, access to the adjacent family-orientated arm of the Cleopatra complex and attentive service throughout our stay. The bedrooms and bathrooms are large and contemporary, and the atmosphere is relaxed on account of it being open to adults-only. Staff deserve particular praise for being friendly, welcoming, accommodating and upbeat at all times. Visiting in early March meant it wasn't too busy, but since it's not as large as other nearby resorts, it never felt eerie and was never too noisy either - combined with the excellent weather throughout, it is a resort I recommend for couples.",

The staff are amazing and we would like to thank , Khalid for food service, Mo for bar service at pool, Ibrahim for our room and Oscar for making us laugh . \nAlthough the rooms are a little dated they are fine , plenty space and always kept clean and stocked with toiletries and water , we were in room 1107 and although a little noisey for the two hours of the entertainment in the evenings it was quiet by 11 pm and Ibrahim always made sure our room was cleaned and serviced each day .\nThe food in the market place was generally good with plenty of choice and the freshly made omelettes were particularly good for breakfast Khalid was siesta in hand to make sure we had everything we needed.\nThe food in the Italian restaurant was outstanding and I recommend you use your free passes for there !\nThe infinity pool is stunning and there was always plenty of space and beds and drinks are kept flowing by the amazing Mo !\nAlthough we were worried about being pestered by the people around the pool selling their services and trips etc it became very apparent that if you were just honest , clear  and polite and said you weren’t interested they understood , however we did have such a good time chatting with a couple of them particularly Oscar from the on site beauty salon , he is such a lovely, happy, friendly guy and we laughed with him many times and although we didn’t take up the use of the beauty salon many people did ! The other guy was a self proclaimed George Clooney look alike who offered quad biking, camel riding trips etc .. he was hysterical and we chatted most days .. again without making us feel uncomfortable for not using his services.\nTo sum up .. this hotel is safe, clean, great facilities, generally good food but absolutely excellent service from all the staff.",

Shout out to the life guard Mohamed who always made sure we had the correct amount of sun or shade plus so much banter. To Oscar and Eslam from the spa, both so kind and generous and went out their way and beyond expectations. Big shout out to the bar man at the swim up bar who never ever let our drinks run dry and always remembered our orders and entertained our daughter. Thanks Sameh and Elsayed. Our rooms were always so well maintained, we had daily towel set when we came back from the pool. \n\nThe complex in general was 1st class, the beach and snorkelling was amazing and lots of other activities to do, We have seen various comments about the food, my only advise is to remind anyone who is going that this is Egypt and now Dubai or somewhere like that. This is absolutely 5* for Egypt but don’t think it will match up to 5* in other more affluent parts of the world.",
