However, some of the towels were dirty and stains on them. The room had a large balcony which was also nice. Pool area was lovely and the beach too. All the of the staff were absolutely amazing, especially Ahmed at the pool bar in the afternoon/evening. The entertainment team were very friendly and put on a good show each night. The staff were all so friendly and would come and talk to us each day. \nThere were people coming round trying to sell trips/advertise their shops which did get annoying as it was constant but after you said no they‚Äôd leave you alone for the day.\nThe only complaint we had was about the food, we skipped breakfast each day as there was nothing we liked and dinners were just as bad. The lunch by the beach was the only good meal each day. There was no what we‚Äôd call \n‚Äòstandard‚Äô all inclusive food. This may be because we came out of season. \nIn general, we had an amazing stay and are hoping to be back next year!",
