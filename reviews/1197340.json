      "text": "Stayed here for one day to wait for our flight following a dive trip. Worse stop gap hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Receptionist were quite unfriendly, we had to wait nearly an hour to be shown our rooms, which we‚Äôd already found on the map. This is so the porter could have a tip by showing us how the curtains open. We had no towels in our room so had to return to reception. When they arrived the staff member expected a tip too. Our rooms were clean but in need of an update.\nWe were not told at reception that there were fixed times for lunch and we had to book, so when we walked in to the restaurant, we were told to return in 90 minutes at 2pm. The bars did not have snacks. The beer is as expected in all inclusive places, poor quality but wet and cold. The food was quite reasonable, freshly cooked chicken and beef burgers. There was a pasta station. The salads were served for you and the portions were large. The layout of the food meant there were quite big queues. \nHalf the place looks like a building site. There is no free Wi-Fi.  There were no sun beds available at the beach when we got there, most guests obviously knew the drill and got there early. The pools however were empty, colder than the sea, but quite refreshing when you got used to it. On the whole a cheap looking, tired place.",
