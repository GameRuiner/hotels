Your efforts are appreciated and recognised. Superb spanakopita especially on our first morning! The place was welcoming, clean, relaxing and generally just fabulous. \n\nThis is absolutely not a problem nor a criticism in the slightest but merely a suggestion: Breakfast is served between 0800-1000 - we were the only guests on one of the evenings and we like to be lazy in the morning! So maybe if the scenario of people who prefer a lazier/later breakfast presents itself again - offering the chance to have it just an hour later could make a huge difference to your guests. \n\nWell done everyone at Zacosta. When we’re in Rhodes next time we’ll certainly return!",
