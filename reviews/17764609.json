      "text": "We spent our first five nights in Spain at the Kimpton Vividora in Barcelona.  We were told this was newly remodeled when Kimpton overtook the property.  Overall, very nice, smaller hotel.  We loved the location, in the Gothic corner, on a quiet side street.  Close, but not too close to La Rambla.  The staff were incredibly friendly and absolutely went out of their way to help us.  The staff seemed to be relatively young, professional, and well-trained.  The rooftop bar had incredible views of Barcelona and the male bartender was also great.  We had adjoining rooms (family suite).  Overall, the rooms were small but fairly normal for Europe.  My only minor annoyance was the toilet was located on the opposite side of the bedroom across from the sink/shower.  There also was an open valet, but no closet.  \n\nWhen we return to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at the Kimpton Vividora.  Highly recommend if staying in Barcelona!!",
