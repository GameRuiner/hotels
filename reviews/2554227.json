      "text": "We stayed here for five nights and the hotel is situated about a 10 minute drive from the Dubai Mall and Burj Khalifa which is a must visit and close to a metro station (Business Bay Station - note that if you are taking the Metro it is worth paying the extra for a gold carriage - much less crowded and very comfortable). The hotel staff were friendly and helpful even though we did not really need that much from them. Didn't try the breakfast and the only food we had was a room service pizza which whilst cheap was not the best (bland) but it was late after a long day and we were starving. The room was extremely big with a cooker, fridge, lounge area and balcony in addition to our bedroom - comfortable rather than luxurious but the bed was great and you cannot hear the traffic below (we were on the 13th floor) - it is best described as functional and inexpensive. It suited us very well and if you are looking that type of hotel you could do a lot worse. My wife has just told me that I have not been effusive enough - she really liked it.",

      "text": "PROS:  I think the only positive thing I can say about this place is the location is good - central and close to many attractions.  \n\nCONS: \nThe stove in the kitchen must have been 50 years old.  There is nothing stocked in it.  Although there is a dining table that seats 8, you have dishes and flatware for 2-3 at most.  There is no dishwasher, so once you use your allotted 2 tiny glasses you have to wash them to re-use.  And there is no dishwasher and no dish-washing supplies of any kind.  No dish soap, no dish cloth or dish towel.  We called the front desk on day 1 to ask about supplies for washing dishes and were told someone would bring them.  We asked a half dozen more times over the next several days and at no time did any every show up.\nThe bathroom was disgusting.  The grout between the tiles on the floor and walls and in the shower was dirty and moldy.  There is no outlet in the bathroom where you can plug in the hairdryer.  The only place I could find near a mirror was at the desk but the hairdryer cord is too short so had to slink down in the chair to try to both reach the outlet and see a bit of what I was doing.  The shower has a pane of glass that reaches maybe half-way so water goes all over the floor from the shower.    We had 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel, and 0 facecloths.  Again, asked for more and were told they would be delivered but they never were.  The quality of the towels was also super crappy - it was the same thin scratchy stuff the bath mat is made of.  Lighting in the bathroom is also very poor.  Actually lighting everywhere is poor so good luck trying to apply makeup.\nThe furniture in the living room is extremely old and equally uncomfortable.\nThe most frustrating of all was the washer/dryer.  We specifically selected this place so we would have one but at no time during our stay did it work properly.  It was a washer/dryer combo unit and would wash (sort of) but then would not dry no matter how many hours you left it.  The whole unit bounced and thrashed all around while it was running through these bizarre cycles of spinning at a thousand miles per hour and then would stop dead before resuming what seemed to be a regular tumble.  We complained to the front desk multiple times per day every single day and though they were very pleasant, they were obviously incapable of actually resolving any issues.  The maintenance department actually completely changed the unit out for another one twice during the 6 days we were there.  None actually worked.\nI would never stay here again in a million years.  There are definitely much better options in Dubai.  Save yourself the headache and find another option.",

      "text": "Everything was going fine and smooth until a very very rude and disrespectful person (Mr.Pitambar) nocked on our door and started shouting. I request to look into CCTV camera. \nYes my mother is old and just got to dubai after a knee replacement surgery. I agree there could be a possibility of bed wet as she is a patient. I should have communicated to hotel before as a daughter but i didnt know about anything what was happening until 20 november morning A man came yelling at our door the housr keeping person - Pitambar \npointing a finger out straight into my 66 years old father face is non appropriate. screaming in a hotel lobby is highly disrespectful.Getting into an argument rather blackmailing and out right questioning in an absolute rude tone is very inhumane. I was ashamed and embarrassed that i hosted my parents as my guest at city premier. My parents are senior citizens. Old people who do not deserve disrespect on any level but Pitambar barged at an open door screaming and shouting as it was his housr,his towels & He had the right to speak the way he liked . I never knew in my 35 years of experience that hospitality industry exists of such kind of employees. it's saddening,shoking and very disappointing to have such an experience. my parents do travel often but forget the rudeness of an employee of the hotel,no one even came with such a complaint. It was an experience to remember and learn to not trouble hotel city premier with our existence again. \nAmen! 🙏🏻",
