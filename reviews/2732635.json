      "text": "We stayed at the Vincci Bit at the beginning of March. The hotel out of the main Barcelona strip but is just a short walk away from the tube and a shopping complex. Grab yourself a HOLA travel card that gets you on all public transport for a fraction of the price you would pay back home.\nThe staff on reception speak English very well and are very helpful. \n\nOur room was spacious and clean and had ample storage space. The towels were clean as were the robes and slippers that were provided. \n\nThere is tea and coffee making facilities, a safe and a mini bar. The maid comes every day but you can leave a sign on the door if you wish them not to come in.\n\nThe bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in ages. The blackout curtains are really good. The lights and tv work on a key card system that goes in the slot. Once out everything is off.\n\nThe TV only has Spanish speaking programs with no English subtitles but that was ok for us.\n\nThe breakfast in the hotel was a lively mix of continental, pastries, sausages, bacon and eggs and cereal. There are tea and coffee making machines and fruit juices available too. \n\nThe pool is smaller than looks on the photos and was fenced off. The gym is smaller too .\n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again at a heartbeat.",

      "text": "We stayed here as a family for part of our honey moon in November 2023. The location of the hotel is great with the metro being a five minute walk. \nEverything was going fine until we woke up on the second morning to myself and my 9 month baby being very chesty, when we began getting ready for the day we noticed our pillows covered in mould, we went straight to reception to inform them, and they came to change the bedding around 30 minutes later, they gave us a good will gesture of stale cake and a dried out bowl of pinapple. Sleeping on mould which we was unaware about at the start cause my baby to become hospitalised when we returned home 2 days later. After further complaints when we returned home, the hotel seem to think that this is acceptable behaviour as the bedding is washed at '60Â°', but clearly not dried in the correct environment, and I wouldn't really recommend this hotel or be returning.",

A kind, courteous, caring, smiley stuff:  extra room slippers - here you are, tickets to the Sagrada Familia - certainly, more coffee - no problem, and so on and so on. Cute terrace near the dining room. Amazing breakfasts: local specialties, fruits, delicious coffee, champagne, juice. Clean and comfortable rooms. It was really above all the compliments.

The room was comfortable with an effective heating system when required (just the once). All the staff were excellent friendly and very efficient, one member of staff shone out and that was Paula who was very kind and helpful she is a credit to both herself and the hotel.",
