      "text": "Excellent experience! I felt like being at home but without caring for anything, just enjoying. Once you get familiar with the hotel and the personnel you fel like being part of the family. The personnel is very friendly and kind. Alex, Angela, Anthon, Claudino, Kamal, Matt, Maureen, Shalika and Smarika are names that I’ll remember with pleasure as they’ve been very supportive and helpful and they paid attention to my needs.\nCan you imagine that you can speak and state your remarks and improvement ideas starting with front office up to the GM and that you see corrective actions ? Yes, that’s Staybridge Suites Internet City. Alex helped with all luggage and groceries that I had, Angela and Anthon were great for the breakfast and Charlie Lane’s services, Claudino was always asking for feedback and helping, Kamal was ensuring that the housekeeping team performs outstanding, Matt was supportive and empowering the team, Maureen helped me a lot regarding the reservation details, Shalika and Smarika helped with all related reception upfront services.\nThank you once again for this wonderful experience and I’ll visit you soon to have a Vanilla Iced Coffee. Take care, Nico",

      "text": "Everywhere was clean. The reception was friendly. We had booked the apartment for two adults and two children. Unfortunately, the sofa bed had not been prepared for the children and had to be requested separately. the bed was really comfortable to sleep on. \nThe room was sometimes very cold because we didn't know how to use the air conditioning. Breakfast was tasty. \n\nIt was a wonderful idea that on Mother's Day mothers were taken into account in the flowers. But in practice it doesn't really work because you can't know who the mother is. The children who were with us were told to give a flower to their mother even though their mother wasn't even there. So the employees thought I was a mother, which was amusing. So it's a nice idea, but it doesn't work in practice\n\n",
