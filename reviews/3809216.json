      "text": "Outstanding hotel with the most incredible staff who cannot do enough for you. I am a travel agent and not only do I do my research of hundreds hotels for my clients, but we as a family try to visit as many as we can so I can have the first hand experience. I have never been this impressed with a hotel, facilities and especially people who work here. I had to wait till our last day to write this review as though “something has to go wrong, it can’t be this perfect”. Well, I was wrong, it was absolutely perfect. \n\nWe had Junior family suite with jacuzzi and it’s amazing room, the location of it is perfect, right in the centre of the hotel and if you can’t be bothered to go downstairs for the entertainment in the evening you can watch it from the best seat! Rooms are so clean and well looked after, the hotel itself is spotless. Food is incredible, pools are always clean, housekeeping is doing brilliant job every day, beach is well looked after and even though the pizza corner is never quiet it never seems to run out of pizzas, the entertainment is brilliant, all the cocktails are incredible but most of all it’s the staff. They make this place 10/10. Kids club girls are the friendliest I’ve ever seen and they are incredible with every child remembering everyones names and putting their 100% in every day, especially Maria, Agni and Kate-you are truly wonderful , thank you so much for making my kids days here so fun. Ilas in the day bar not only is friendly and professional but also can never do enough for us always smiling and making us feel welcome no matter how busy he is. \n\nIf you’re looking for hotel in Rhodes, don’t look any further, you will not regret staying here.\n\nThis has been the most incredible holiday surrounded by the most incredible people, thank you, we will definitely be back!",

Special thanks to Yannis, the bartender, and Themis, the bar manager, they offered us exceptional service, they did more than we could have ever imagined. All the ladies at the kids' club were very cheerful and helpful, as well as the majority of the staff actually. Just to name a few: Agni, Sofia and Maria from the kids' club, Agapitos, the waiter at the main restaurant, Josephine at the Mexican restaurant and many others that I don't remember their names. All of them made our stay very pleasant. Not to forget the people arranging for the birthday cake of our younger son who sang the \"Happy birthday\" song in Greek:-)",
